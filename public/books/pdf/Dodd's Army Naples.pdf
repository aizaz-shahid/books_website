Sorry, With the second name now being used, I think there are now too many fields for new users and they might get put off. I have asked a lot of users and they do not like having to enter email address and password twice. Please delete 'Re-enter Email Address" and "Re-enter Password" So, we will now have only 5 fields. \par
\par
Your First Name\par
Your Last Name\par
Email Address \par
Enter a Username\par
Enter a Password\par
\par
NOTE: when the system sends a confirmation message to the new user, is there a way to save the user's details in the database ONLY if the email arrives at destination? If it bounces (wrong email address) the details are not saved and user does not become a member Please advise me if this is possible - or, is there is another way to confirm the user is genuine? Thanks.\par
\par
Please move the captcha down so it lines up with the text entry field (like you have done on contact form.)\par
\par
There is a talktalk image, which displays at smaller screensize. Please delete:\par

Optional link\par
\par
Explanation: each book may have different links: Youtube trailer, Amazon page, etc. They may even have a different facebook and website links. Especially if pen name is used. So the links will come ONLY from book submission NOT from admin. This is why I asked you to use the same form for 'Submit Another Book' You can charge me extra for this tweak \'85 but keep it reasonable! \par

Field borders are too dark: should be same as others. *NOTE: this may be a cross-browser or PS issue: on my iMac I see what is in the images. In the previous dev site this did not happen: the fields are cross-browser/OS friendly. Please check how they did it........done\par
\par
The text size in the fields and buttons do not follow style: should be same style as image and as on old dev site. If you cannot match these you must tell me because it is a design issue. ..........done\par
\par
* When you have finished all the tweaks I will purchase a browserstack account for a month so we can both go through the pages to see exactly how they look on different devices and operating systems. Unless you already have an account?\par

BLOG GALLERY PAGE\par

Subsequent pages in pagination should always show all 7 latest books from the main page.\par
 \par
Are we going to use 'Popular Posts' I am not sure how this would work. If it is a problem, just delete this option. We will just show the latest posts. I suppose there should be an archive link though (as shown in blog-gallery.png) \'85 maybe it would open a page with a list? Let me know what you think.\par

3. 5) b) Close up space between bottom line of text and top of text entry field as image. Currently it is too far apart. Author account is correct, please do same.\par

When developing a site, sometimes things are noticed that were not considered before. This can be charged extra if you wish\'85..\cf1 done\par

SEARCH\par
\par
Thanks for what you did with search, this would be good if users search only for book title and author. However, these are some of the queries put into the google custom search on my site:\par
\par
romance\par
lietha wards\par
harry potter\par
everyone has a story\par
ruth ann nordin\par
paranormal romance\par
love\par
murder\par
crime\par
start business\par
historical romance\par
grey\par
save money\par
sex\par
employment\par
vampire\tab\par
erotica\par
christian fiction\par
divergent\par
\par
As you can see, a couple were for authors but the rest are generic. This means users will search for any subject. \par
\par
Google uses words within these three areas to return closest results:\par
\par
TITLE \par
DESCRIPTION \par
CONTENT\par
\par
Book titles and authors are always within the title tag on the book listing pages. Other related words will probably be inside the description tag or the page content.\par
\par
So, we need an engine thats does a deeper crawl. Basically we need something like google's engine. Nice if we can have thumbnails, but not important. Just text will be fine.\par
\par
For Laravel, I searched and found these which may be possible answers. \par
\par
TNT Search, \par
Laravel Scout\par
Elasticsearch\par
Sphinx\par
\par
Please let me know how you wish to proceed. This is an extra so it is chargeable, but again make the cost reasonable! If there is script you want me to buy, please let me know.\par
\par
IMPORTANT: whichever you choose, please ensure it will ignore robots noindex tags so that ALL pages are cached.\par

'Choose The Book Author' name should be first and second name. I will not know the authors username. I would have to search the database! It was your idea to have first and second name on registration for this purpose. The idea is for me to easily search from a list of authors. See previous dev site set up: {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK http://www.obooko.com/free-ebooks/obk-bk-lis.php }}{\fldrslt{http://www.obooko.com/free-ebooks/obk-bk-lis.php\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs24 .... \cf1 done\par

\par
Good work inserting the Adult filter option. However, I cannot get it to turn OFF. Please check\par
b) When the Adult Filter is ON, the 3 Adsense adverts should CHANGE to the 3 Adult (17+) codes as in Advert Manager. (Adsense cannot appear on any adult related page.)......... \cf1 done\par
\cf0\par
'Choose The Book Cover Image' list should be alphabetical. This will be very difficult for me to locate files: there will be well over 2000! It works in the previous dev site: {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK http://www.obooko.com/free-ebooks/obk-bk-lis.php }}{\fldrslt{http://www.obooko.com/free-ebooks/obk-bk-lis.php\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs24  \par

'Please Select' in download panel does not display the 3 files.....()\par
working fine on my pc..plz check it with another book \par
If I delete a file in 'Files/ Manage Files' the files still appears in the book listing edit page.

ALSO, if I try to overwrite a file in edit page it does not work. In fact on one try I got an error (TokenMismatchException in VerifyCsrfToken.php line 67:) So, I need a way to either delete a file so I can upload a new one or be able to overwrite existing. Please advise. ..... \cf1 done and you can overwrite files but the filename will remain same\par
