I was really missing him. I remember I had this argument with him one time. I don\rquote t know exactly what the cause of it was but it must have been over something dumb I had done. You know the kind of stupid stuff we used to argue about. Well anyway, he had called me out on it and I took the bait. I told him that if he didn\rquote t like the way I acted then \lquote tough\rquote . He had help raised me up and half of me was him and so it stood to reason that he was part to blame. Dad said that the way I went about my business was my choice and had nothing at all to do with him or you. Whether I was just being dog headed and trying to rial him or if that was what I truly believed, i\rquote m not quite sure now. I carried that idea around for a hell of a long time, especially after he died. I felt guilty for saying that. He was right enough though. People are their own people. I know that now. I guess I always did. Seeing the boys grow up, seeing how different each is from the other and both not a bit like me. I can\rquote t say that I see much of their father in them either, thank God. Seems with some people, it doesn\rquote t matter what you do, you could try and help them in a million different ways and they would still end out the same. It\rquote s like we somehow latch onto our destiny, nothing can shake us off from fulfilling it. You can dam up a river for so long but it will always run its course eventually.

Performing his daily tasks over and over again without a thought as to whether or not it was really what he wanted from this life. It was his willingness to accept his situation that meant he must surely be happy. Why wouldn't he be, he lived comfortably and had good health, a steady and reliable job. All the trappings of a modern life. Every morning Beaton caught the six twenty four train into the city and every night he would return by the six fifteen. At weekends he studied all the newspapers at the local library and did his weekly shop and paid his bills.

Still the days rolled in and out like the waves on a shore and the weeks, like the tides, rose and fell away from the calendar without anything truly interesting ever happening.\par \tab Then, like a house of cards, the precarious structure that he had erected for himself, came crashing to the floor. A weak lintel amongst the many strong, unable to support his burdens any longer. A fault line, a corrosion from within. The busted valve that brought everything to a grinding stop. Four weeks to the day, before his court sentence, the train that Beaton Arnold Earnest was travelling on became stuck in a tunnel. Beaton sat in the dark and listened to the hushed whispers and panicked breath of his fellow passengers and felt the slight alien tingle of excitement from somewhere deep inside. He imagined all the reasons why the train could be stuck, a multitude}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid1986307  of scenarios and terrors clamo}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid14838232\charrsid615944 ring for space inside of his screaming mind. \par \tab 'What if another train should collide with us?\rquote  he marvelled. 'All that twisted metal and smoke, a blinding white flash and nothing more or Better still, what if a bomb goes off?\rquote  \par \tab He sat and fantasised of all the things that could happen in such Darkness A dark twitch, the uncoiling of a sour black worm inside Beaton\rquote s brain. He reached out as if to to rest his palm on the person next to him. Somebody had stepped on his foot and the corner of a suitcase had found the temple of his head. A crush of bodies and muttered curses and apologies. Further down the train a child started to cry and very soon the darkness ceased to be a source of excitement. He was glad at last when the lights returned to the carriage and the driver announced that the journey would shortly be commencing. It was a minor incident but it was the tiny spark that touched the tinder, the wind that fanned the flame.\par \tab When Beaton went to bed that evening, the ghost of his feelings that day returned to him in the night time of his room. He couldn't sleep and he lay awake and imagined that he was still in the tunnel, with all the other passengers, waiting. He began a train of thought in which he likened the Town to the broken down carriage. Everyone in the night time of the Town waiting in the shadows for the lights to come back on and for the world to wake up and start moving again. In his fantasy he roamed the night like a phantom, hovering over the townsfolk, drinking in their fear like a bat with a humming birds beak. Noiselessly beating his wings as he fluttered from house to house. He was the shadow caught in the corner of the eye, the devil waiting at the foot of the bed. He wished he was death. Beaton felt something snap inside of him and sunk beneath the weight of his loneliness. He was gripped by a terrible fear that he had hitherto never felt before. It was the fear of obscurity, of never being realised. A fear that tomorrow will be just the same as yesterday was and that nothing would ever change for. On and on it would go, like the waves on the shore. Turning him over like a stone, rolling and wearing him down into nothing. He heard once again the terrible scream of a frightened child but it was merely the cry of the foxes in the garden. Beaton wished that somebody would step on his foot to shake him from this waking dream. He knocked his head with his fists and the hot fat tears rolled down his face but the lights stayed out and he sobbed like he was a child, there was no driver here to start this train again.\par \par Tuesday 20th\par \par \tab His alarm had not woken him, he was sure he had set it. He felt for his watch on the side cabinet. He ran his thumb over its shattered face. Rough slices marred its smooth glass surface. \par \tab 'It must have happened in the crush of people on the train.\rquote  He stretched the gold metal wrist band over his hand. His arm would always felt naked without his watch. He looked out the window at the dead leaves and the sodden lawn. The bare trees, like biology textbook drawings of capillary systems, were stamped onto a skyline of cheap red brick houses. The cold steel frames of the gas works rising on the horizon above the empty sports field and the humped ramparts made by the railway tracks. Clouds of white steam from next doors boiler drifted past his window and melted into the grey sky. The scene outside gave him no clues as to what time of day it was. He realised that this place did not know him at this time of day at this point in the week. He should have been at work. \par \tab 'I could still call in, they would understand', he picked up the receiver but placed it back down immediately. 'I seem to spend most of my times financing these empty rooms and I'm hardly ever even here at all.\rquote  Standing stock still he listened carefully, straining his ears. The rattle of the boiler, the ticking of a clock on the mantle, a cooing of a pigeon perched on the chimney above, the sound of hammering off in the distance. This house didn't need him, it didn't even want him here, it ran perfectly well all by itself. He fixed himself some breakfast of coffee, two slices of toast, butter and marmalade. He munched on his breakfast whilst listening to the radio. The weatherman warned of record breaking snowfall in the coming days.\par \tab Beaton walked past the dismal rows of terraced houses that were common to that part of his town. Their pebble dashed facades streaked with years of black grime from burst gutters and hoppers clogged with moss and leaves. There was little sign of life on the weekday street. A man working on a roof was doing something to a chimney stack. The postman with his bicycle receded from view then reappeared as he played out his daily dance down the road from door to door. A cat blinked from a sitting room window. The few shops and businesses on the estate had long since closed down or moved away. Beaton tried to recall how they had changed over time.\par \tab 'That used to be the old fire station.\rquote  he thought to himself \lquote and after that it was a video shop. The one on the corner was the butchers and that became a nail bar. In the end all we had were nail bars and beauty salon. Nothing of any use to anyone any more.' He kicked at a flattened can as he walked along, it bounced and rattled up the street. 'All people want is shit. Shit, shit and more shit. They don't really know they're actually alive.'\par \tab A narrow lane cut through to some garages and led around to the back of an abandoned factory and their derelict workshops. He crossed an open car lot that was used by some of the townsfolk as a popular dumping ground. Weeds had begun to reclaim the concrete surface that was crumbling and pock marked in places. An upturned sofa, it's lining torn and the springs exposed. Car tyres, a shopping trolley, a stack of half burnt pallets on a sodden mattress. A rusting yellow generator forgotten, filthy and flyblown. Itself a victim of the numerous types of failed contracts, lost opportunities and half hearted regeneration projects that came and went and never came back again. The money finally running out. At the end of the lot was a muddy path through some tall nettles. It was well used by dog walkers and teenagers alike. The high banks of the railway tracks were covered with buddleia and blackberry bushes. Their purple blossom a distant memory, the hard black fruits on the thorny brambles a left over reminder of a summer past. A low tunnel beneath the train tracks opened out onto a disused towpath. The path ran alongside the railway line for some distance before making its own way south away from the town and up to a disused quarry. The canal was mostly dry from water except in a few boggy places. If you looked carefully enough you could still make out the trees that had been planted at even spaces along its route. Beaton always felt like he was walking through the onion layers of time when he walked along here. From the Car park to the Railway tracks and out onto the old canal.\par \tab \par \tab Beaton }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid16453515 had}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid14838232\charrsid615944  not been out here for years. This was the very place he had last spent time with Marie. \par \tab 'How can you just up and leave somebody, no word, nothing. It was cold, inhuman, heartless.' Maybe they had been too young, maybe he hadn't always been very loving. 'I did try, I did try. I got help but she was the one that gave up on me. I never gave up on her.' After Marie was gone he had scarcely time to grieve for his loss before he had thrown himself back into his work and started reassembling his life. Memories of a young nervous girl with long chestnut curls.\par \tab 'You know that I love you Beaton and what we share can never be taken away.' He paused to watch a Heron fishing in some shallow water some distance off, \lquote They're quite rare now', he thought to himself but the memories of Marie still forced themselves back into his head. 'We met at the wrong time' she had said to him once, what did that even mean. \lquote People meet when they meet, that couldn't be controlled. \par \tab The heron made a quick stab at something in the water with its long smooth beak. An excited dog bounded up behind Beaton and with a flapping of it's great wings the Bird launched itself up into the air. The concentric ripples on the black oily surface calmed and faded and all traces of the magnificent creature were finally gone. The Springer Spaniel stared up at Beaton, with it's tongue lolling and a keen idiotic expression.\rquote \par \tab \lquote You scared her off you stupid fool.\rquote  he muttered to himself. He patted the dogs flanks and ruffled the hair under its chin but on hearing a shrill whistle the dog up and went in a burst of excitement back in the direction it had come from. The happy, contented, dutiful dog.\par \tab \par \tab The dark brown limbs of the trees were touched with fine filaments of gold. The winter sun was weak and low and the pale sky faded into a hazy brown where it fell behind the woods up ahead. He had been walking the tow path for a good while it seemed. The temperature dropped as he entered the woods. The canopy let little light through its tangled thatch to create a gloomy, heavy atmosphere. The path through the woods was high banked on either side and climbed up and away from the tow path. There was little trace of the Town here. The ground was muddy and bare and in places the path became so boggy that Beaton had to pick his way carefully along its banks to get around the wide puddles.\par \tab \lquote I wonder what she looks like now, its been so long since I\rquote ve seen her. I always imagined that we would grow old together. I guess I\rquote m jaded, I just gave up after she left. Its not like I haven\rquote t had my chances. The desire has just disappeared.\rquote  He had tried to find her several times, aggressively pursuing her for the first three years after her departure. He then hit a dead wall and was forced to give up. Deep down he was glad that he still, in name at least, had a wife but it was the final thing that kept her in his life. It kept him waiting, hoping and even if he knew that she was never coming back, he still at least had a wife. He believed he was in love with her and he nurtured and mourned this unrequited love until it became a source of comfort to him. After all it was the only thing he had left. So Beaton continued to work as if nothing had changed and carried on as he had always done, his home a shrine to the past. Not more than a week ago Marie had rung Beaton. She had demanded a divorce. It was as abrupt as her flight from his life and just as final. He refused. He called her a whore and swore that he would kill her if he ever got his hands on her. She had ruined his life.\par \tab The woods began to thin out and the light breaking through was a welcome change from the heavy atmosphere of the dense canopy. \par \tab 'I always feel I'm being watched in here, the path sits so low, it would be the perfect place for an ambush'. \par \tab The path broke free of the trees and ran between two rude wooden fences that cut across a wild meadow for roughly half a kilometre or so. A stile gave way to a wide trackway that ran crosswise to the muddy path he was on. Heading southwards, the trackway climbed upwards as it hugged the steep brow of the valley side. The ground rolling away to his left revealed the Town below. Its rows of houses laid out before him, his  whole world so small, so tiny. Maybe this was where Marie had been when she had made up her mind to leave him and never come back.\par \tab  'What have I waited here for. Preserving a dead memory while she's been carrying on like I never existed.'\par \tab The clumps of trees in the distance gave a deceptive impression of how large the wooded quarry actually was. At one time the whole of the landscape was dominated by the great forests that ran the length and breadth of the country. Now the towns and cities with their surrounding agricultural and industrial landscapes had divided and scarred the land. Forcing the trees to retreat, to cluster in the nooks of valleys and crowd along the edges of rivers and lakes. The trackway approached the old stone quarry from above and from this angle the woods appeared to be little more than a small grove. The trees covering the descending slopes of the hillside formed what was a surprisingly large forest littered with the disused mining pits that had once been the main source of the towns wealth. Huge white dolomites of oolitic limestone had been heaved from the bowels of this earth and transported on the canals all over the countryside. An enterprise which was in its own way as every bit as breathtaking as the construction of stonehenge or some such ancient monument. \par \tab The entrance to the woods ran around the tops of the largest of the pits. Beaton had always been surprised at how easy it was to become lost in here as it all looked so familiar. It was if a giant hand had taken an ice cream scoop to the land and removed great concave chunks from the hillside. From these open cast mines, engineers had dug out a warren of tunnels into the valley side as it had become harder to extract more and more of the stone. Cracks in the earth and sumps were not unknown, rifts in the rich brown earth revealing the clean chalky white glow of the limestone just beneath its surface. A series of small winding paths linked the pits, they were steep and knotted with the roots of trees. Large coiled ferns grew between the boulders that were strewn all around. The ground, alive with rotting leaves, gave off a heady verdant black smell. The air here was always damp, the temperature low.\par \tab 'This place always feels prehistoric.\rquote  Beaton thought to himself. \lquote It is like stepping into another world. The air feels cooler and the light, there\rquote s something different about it. It\rquote s like the quarry wants you to be here. I never could really explain it.\rquote \par \tab Someone had made a circular hearth of large stones in one of the pits. The stones were burnt ashen white along their inner wall. An empty vodka bottle in a blue plastic bag. Further along he found the severed rope swing dangling, ominous, a hangman's noose. The blue nylon rope was tied to a thick tree limb jutting out over a sheer drop, its ends frayed and worn like the tail of a horse. It had been there ever since he was a boy. The walls of the cliff formed the shape of a horse shoe. He peered over the edge, it made him feel a little queazy.  There were too many childhood ghosts in these woods for him to ever feel like he was alone. Another life buried beneath the one which he had created for himself. The mild mannered man that his colleagues at work knew and his neighbours saw, a million miles away from the person he saw inside. The real Beaton that Maria had finally discovered for herself. The man who she had discovered that made her leave hand never come back.\par \tab  At the bottom of the pit was the wreck of a burnt out old motorbike. Somebody had thrown down some tins of paint, there were large purple splatter marks on some of the rocks below. He made his way down along the top of the cliff edge until he reached the bottom of the pit. He looked up to where he had been standing. The rope swing didn't seem so high from down here. The old bike lay on its side.\par \tab 'I wonder if they drove it off the top or set it alight from down here?' \par \tab He turned over one of the paint tins with his foot. Black water slopped out onto his shoe. At the bottom of the tin was a thick hard crust of dried purple paint. Beaton made his way through the boulder field towards the base of the cliff. The cave entrance was like the gaping maw of some hungry beast. Its grimacing mouth turned down at each corner. Although at first you had to crouch to enter inside, the floor quickly fell away into a large domed entrance chamber. \par \tab \lquote Marie was always so scared of this place. She hated it, wouldn't come in with me. Said that it gave her the creeps to think about all the miners who were trapped and killed.\par \tab There were two tunnels leading directly off of the entrance chamber. Two black sockets quarried from the skull white rock. The walls were sprayed with graffiti. Some of it the work of kids but most of it was the work of caving enthusiasts who had explored and surveyed the mines. Arrows and letters in varying colours gave directions to various routes through and around the hillside. Beaton took the tunnel to the right. Great hulking pieces of limestone had fallen from the roof of the cave and he had to scramble over them to continue. As the tunnel began to bend the light faded and his legs refused to take him any further. He was about to turn and make his way back but something made him hesitate. \par \tab 'What was she so afraid of in here'. There was nothing down here save for the darkness and the rock. He sat down on a low flat slab, the cold seeped through his trousers into the backs of his thighs. 'Why should anyone be afraid of the dark'. It was no accident that he found himself here, he knew it existed and he had chosen to come here. But why?\par \tab In the midst of the deafening silence he heard the clatter of a stone falling. A sound that echoed through the tunnel and was made louder by a complete lack of sound and sight. Most likely the click clack of loose stones falling from a crack in the crumbling ceiling. A logical, innocent, explainable noise that turned Beaton's blood into glue and sent his whole body into a spasm, his whole being rigid with fear. \par \tab 'What was it, what could it be, but nothing, did I hear it at all. I should leave, this is \par ridiculous, I should be at work not scaring myself down here, what was I thinking'. The noise replayed in his head, again and again. Each time it was amplified and distorted, over and over. He gave it a face, a body, a translucent shell. A thousand rangy insect limbs crept towards him. Moving through the dark, an eyeless white insect that crept towards him, aware of his every move. It reached out a feeler to touch him. Suddenly his legs were free again and moving with great speed, he ran towards the entrance chamber and clambered up the steep slope. The scree beneath his feet gave way underfoot and the world came crashing up to hit him in the chest. Rolling over and lying on his back, he looked up into the canopy above him and laughed at what his own childish fear had made him do.'You fool, you stupid fool.\rquote \par \tab \par \tab The first flakes of snow that winter drifted down. They briefly clung to his skin before melting away. He lay like that for a while with his eyes closed. His hands resting on his stomach, he ran his hands up over his rib cage.\par \tab 'I'm so hungry, It must be lunch time. I must of just forgot'.\par \tab The light was beginning to fade but it must have been only just a little past three in the afternoon. Raising himself onto his elbow, Beaton looked out across the approach to the mine entrance. There on a rock, no less than a few metres stood a large Alsatian dog. It was staring at him like a ghost from the past, he didn't know how long it had been there. The wiry brown and black fur of its coat was well camouflaged against the dim shades of the trees and the rocks. Behind him and further off in the distance stood a woman. She wore a green waxed jacket and was holding a leash. From such a distance, he could not tell if she was young or old. Her mousey blond hair was pulled back into a pony tail. Her face was lean, her stare was blank and gave nothing away. \par \tab 'Maybe she doesn't see me, she maybe looking at the dog'.\par \tab As he went to raise his hand to say hello the woman turned and continued on her way and passed from view. The Alsatian, turned to watch the woman disappear, took one more look at Beaton and then hurried off in the same direction. The silver loops of its collar jingling as he went. \par \tab Beaton got up dusted himself down and walked to a bikeway that ran in front of the face of the quarry. There was no sign of anyone. A thin footpath led down the hillside through undergrowth that was tangled thick with dark green ivy. The  path left the woods and met a steep road at the back of some allotments near to a small housing estate and some wooden sheds. The street lamps had come on and from where he stood, Beaton could see the lights of the city laid out before him in the distance. A dense cluster of orange and yellow stars. He Stumbled forward  down the hill as fast as he could go with an aching hunger deep in his gut and his fingers numb with the cold. The road soon levelled out at the bottom of the hill where a low stone bridge forded a weir. The buildings here were much older than those further up the hill and although at one point this small medieval hamlet had boasted six public houses, today only one remained. The two storey building was low and long made of the limestone pulled down from the quarry above. The pains of the leaded windows winked as he walked by. Inside looked warm and welcoming. Fitting then that it should have been aptly named The Quarrymen's Arms.\par \tab }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid14838232 \par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid7996025 \par \par \par \par \par \par \par \par }\pard \ltrpar\ql \li0\ri0\sl-320\slmult0\nowidctlpar\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0\pararsid7996025 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid7996025\charrsid7996025 Please note: This is a free digital edition from www.obooko.com.

The ceiling was low and bridged by ancient oak beams. From the wood panelled walls hung the types of fittings and fixtures typical to public houses up and down the country. A fruit machine blinked in the corner. To the left, a good fire blazed in a good sized hearth. Hanging above the chimney breast was a huge rusted double handled bucksaw, its steel serrated edge with teeth as big as any found in the skull of a shark. A relic from the quarries themselves. A middle aged couple were sitting before the fire on a worn red leather sofa drinking and chatting amongst themselves. They didn't look up. To Beaton's right was a series of small wooden seating booths divided by screens of dark mahogany and frosted glass. In one of them, all alone, was an old man reading a newspaper. At the far end of the room two men held counsel over a round wooden table like two monks. One was in his early twenties and the other looked to be in his fifties. They could have been father and son but it was clear by their body language that they were not. Beaton chose an empty bar stool and rested his foot on the brass rail. The counter was tarnished with cloudy white water stains. The beer matts were grubby, there corners fibrous and blown from being used long after they should have been thrown away. He read the names of the beers on the pump handles. He didn't recognise any of them. He wasn't much of a beer drinker and he couldn't remember the last time he had been in a public house. Probably some work do he had been obliged to attend. Behind the bar was a mirror with shelves running across it. The shelves contained different coloured bottles of various shape and size. Bar snacks, in their metallic plastic wrappings hung from their cardboard backings. A chalk board that may once have had a menu or wine list on it had been hastily scrubbed out. A door behind the bar was slightly ajar but not nearly enough as to allow anyone to see inside. Beaton looked around to catch an eye but nobody seemed responsible for running the place. He thought about ringing the shiny brass bell that hung from the glass racks above the counter but he was not that brave. He turned on his bar stall and rested his elbows behind him on the counter top. He was studying the flames in the fireplace. They danced and licked and nipped out at the heavy log which looked as if it was squashing the life out of the glowing embers it rested upon. \par \tab 'What'll it be' came a voice behind Beaton. He turned around. Standing behind the bar was a man in his late sixties. He had a full auburn beard. His hair was chestnut brown and streaked with grey at the sides. He was tall, thick set with a ruddy red complexion. He rested his two hands on the top of a beer pump like a lumberjack might lean on the haft of an axe.\par \tab 'Do you have a menu please?' replied Beaton. \par \tab 'No menu i'm afraid, all we have here you can see in front of you' Beaton looked around as though he was searching for something, he looked at the scrubbed out black board hopefully. \par \tab 'You don't serve food.' \par \tab 'No sir, as I said everything is right here. We got pork scratchings, peanuts and crisps,   \par \tab plenty of crisps, if its a restaurant your wanting then you'll have to go into town.'The barman straightened himself up as if defending the honour of the pub. \par \tab 'No, no its fine. I'll have a packet of crisps and a packet of pork scratchings, please.' \par \tab 'You won't be wanting a drink?'. \par \tab 'A drink, yes a drink too of course.' He looked around the bar again, searching. \par \tab 'Do you have wine?' The barman released a short sigh from his nostrils. \par \tab 'We don't have wine, If it's a wine bar your wanting then you'll\u8230\'c9' \par \tab 'No, no }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid1986307 that\rquote s}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid14838232\charrsid615944  fine, beer is fine. I'll take that one there.\rquote  Beaton tapped the pump that the barman was leaning on. \par \tab 'Right O then.\rquote  Bringing down a glass from above the bar and placing it below the brass tap, the barman pulled on the pump. He leaned his body into his work as though it took a great deal of strength to draw the liquid up from the casks in the basement below. The glass filled with the amber brown liquid, a weak foam settling on its surface. The barman set the glass down unceremoniously on the bar, causing the contents of the glass to slosh onto his hand. He wiped it on a grimy looking towel that was thrown across his shoulder.\par \tab 'There ye are, anything else for yer?' \par \tab 'No, thank you, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid1986307 that\rquote s}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid14838232\charrsid615944  fine.\rquote  \par \tab 'Then that'll be four seventy please sir.'\par \tab Beaton paid the barman with a five pound note, received his change and carried his beer and his bar snacks to the back of the pub, as far from the publican as was possible. He sat in one of the empty booths near to the two men who were huddled over their table locked in conversation. He tentatively took a sip from his pint. The beer was warm and flat and tasted sour. He opened the pork scratchings, and bit into one. As his upper teeth worked to bite through the thick crust of the pig skin his lower teeth sunk into its soft moist underside. \par \tab 'Ugh, Christ, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid1986307 that\rquote s}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid14838232\charrsid615944  awful' It was salty and unpleasant. He pulled another scratching from the bag and held it up for inspection. He could see the hairs on the surface of the brown fried skin. 'What was I thinking?\rquote  He decided in stead to eat the peanuts. 'You know where you stand with peanuts.\rquote  he thought to himself.  \par \tab He dumped the bag of scratchings into a large ashtray, a couple of them fell into his lap. He started to work on opening the packet of roasted peanuts. Something powerful and heavy shoved against his legs beneath the table making them jerk upwards in surprise, bashing his knees hard against the table top. Everything on the table jumped. The glass tumbled sideways sending a flood of spilt beer fanning across the table and cascading over the edges.\par \tab 'Shit, shit, shit'. Beaton stood up and and wiped at his beer soaked trousers with his bare hands. The dog continued to root around under the table between his legs. A large wagging tale visible standing up at the end of the table. \par \tab 'Kaiser, get. Get out a there, get. Go on, off with you!' \par \tab The barman rushed at the table and heaved the great beast out by its collar. He gave the animal a swift kick and set about mopping up the mess. The dog ran behind the bar and through the adjoining door. The two men on the next table who had been watching this all taking place, began to laugh loudly.\par \tab 'He's got a nose on him }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid1986307 that\rquote s}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid14838232\charrsid615944  for sure' said the younger man.\lquote A right nose for trouble, hey mike you should have got a smaller dog or a bigger pub.\rquote  They continued to laugh whilst the barman\rquote s face blackened with suppressed rage beneath his knitted brows. He continued to soak up the beer with sodden balls of blue paper towel. Beaton standing in the corner silently like a scolded child, still holding the almost empty pint glass. \par \tab \lquote Why don't the two of you\rquote s get the fuck home, that\rquote ll make plenty more room in here, or \tab maybe you fancy a kick up the arse too'. The two men laughed again and went back to talking amongst themselves. 'I'll get you another drink, I'm sorry about your trousers. That Kaiser's got a keen sense of smell and is stubborn as an ox to boot. If you go into the gents you'll find a hand dryer to dry off with, here take some of these.\rquote  The barman handed Beaton a wad of paper towel. \par \tab 'Thanks, It's fine. Honest, could I think I just have a glass of water instead.'\par \tab \lquote Right O, suit yerself, water it is.' Beaton could sense that the barman had already had quite enough of his new customer.\par \tab The toilets were cold and rank, the white tiles cracked and yellowing. The blue cakes that littered the metal urinal trough could not hide the overwhelming smell of piss. There was a single cubicle at the far end of the room with a single tiny sash window. Next to the sink was a hand dryer. He placed his hands beneath the chrome funnel and waited for the warm air to start. He lifted one leg up to get closer to the warmth, lifting the wet canvas away from his skin with one hand. The machine wasn't very powerful.\par \tab 'This might take some time.'\par \tab  Beaton noticed a condom machine next to the hand dryer. As he was reading the options available, one of the men from the table next to him walked in and started to piss loudly into the urinal. \par \tab 'Feeling lucky, eh fella.\rquote  Beaton had always hated idle chit chat and Idle chit chat was even worse when people tried to conduct it in public toilets. \par \tab 'No, not lucky at all actually.' \par \tab 'Never mind, never mind, your not the first person to have lost there drink to that stupid old dog, damn things a pest.

Beaton switched legs beneath the dryer and gave the other one a go. \par \tab 'So that dog belongs to Mikes wife then?'\par \tab 'Well it belonged to the boy, Jonathan was his name. He loved that dog. They were best of buddies.  Ahh, sad, real sad it was.' The man had stopped pissing and after buttoning himself away, stood swaying in front of the sink. 'Just a little boy when he died, no parent should lose a child. It's unnatural is what it is.\rquote The man staggered out of the toilets leaving Beaton stood on one leg holding his knee in the air. The sound of the hand dryer humming loudly. \par \tab Beaton went back to his chair. There was a glass of water with lemon waiting for him. The barman had gone. The men talked amongst themselves as before. The old man still read his newspaper, the couple remained coupled. Still standing he sipped at his water and pocketed the unopened bag of peanuts. He made his way to the door quickly and out into the street. The air felt cold on the damp patches around his crotch, the snow was still falling.\par \tab \par \tab \lquote So it is Jonathan\rquote s dog. The family hasn\rquote t moved after all these years. All these years and still here, why were they still here, strange to meet again after all this time.\rquote  It was a long walk home but he had his memories to keep him company.\par \par Wednesday 21st\par \par \tab Beaton awoke in the cold grey dawn with an aching in his belly. He had not set his alarm clock again but he knew that it was still early. He fixed himself a plate of eggs and washed it down with several cups of coffee. He went to the phone by the kitchen door, picked it up and dialled. The last phone call had been yesterday. It was his office number. He returned the receiver to the cradle and walked over to the kitchen sink. Outside it was snowing still, it had settled about and inch or so. He took a pencil from a cup on the window sill and sat back down at the kitchen table. On a scrap of paper he began to write out a list. Out in the hallway, by the coat stand, was a low wooden coal scuttle with brass fittings that was now used for storing shoes. Opening up the wooden door at the front, Beaton reached in a pulled out an old blue canvas rucksack with leather straps. He untied the string around its neck and emptied its contents back into the metal drawer inside the wooden box. The bag had been filled with old tins of shoe polish, shammy leathers and brushes. Back in the kitchen he found some cans of soup and a tin of sardines and put them in the bag. In a draw by the cooker he found a box of safety matches and a flashlight. He switched it on. Nothing happened. Unscrewing the cap at the base of the handle, he removed the large cylindrical batteries, a green and white crust had oozed from the contact points and dried there. He threw the batteries to the back of the drawer and added torch to the contents of the bag. He opened the cutlery draw and removed a sharp knife and a tin opener.\par \tab From the window sill he took a small pad of paper and a pen. He went upstairs to his bedroom and started to rummage around at the back of the cupboard. He pulled out an old brown woollen blanket, the sort of thing that looked as if it was only good now for lining the boot of a car. He spread it out onto the bed and dumped the contents of the bag on top of it. Taking the four corners of the blanket he gathered together the miscellany of objects in a tight bundle and forced it back into the canvas bag. He put on thick woollen socks and squeezed his feet into a pair of stout leather hiking boots. He dusted of an old  pair of his fathers pigskin driving gloves and put them into the pocket of his duffle coat. In the other pocket he found his navy blue knitted hat. He pulled it down over his ears, checked that he had his wallet on him and swung the bag over his shoulder. He stood like this for a few minutes in the centre of the room, thinking. Back downstairs in the kitchen he made a thermos of coffee and put it in the bag with the rest of his things. After checking over in his mind that there was nothing that he might had forgotten he closed the front door behind him. The latch clicked into place with the assured spring loaded sound of mechanical finality. It was this sound that reminded him that he had forgotten to take his keys from the nightstand table. He patted himself down hopefully but he knew already that they were still sitting in the dish upstairs where he had left them last night.\par \tab 'Oh well' He thought. 'I will have to work that one out later.'\par \tab He was glad to be away from the house again, he couldn't help feeling unwelcome there during the daytime.

She had first encountered him on the previous afternoon whilst walking Kaiser in the quarry. The man was lying on his back looking up at the falling rain and he appeared to be laughing. It was the very same spot where they had found Jonathan lying. On his back on the cold cold ground, his face wet with the rain. The second time she saw him, he was walking down the high street carrying a rucksack. He moved through the crowd with purpose, he looked as if he was deep in thought.\par \tab 'Strange that I should see him twice now when I had never seen him at all before. As well, to see him lying in that exact same spot.' She decided to follow him, she realised it was a strange thing to do but she decided that it couldn't hurt to follow him for a short distance at least. It was the memory of Jonathan lying still on the quarry floor that spurned her on to do it.

The man weaved his way through the throng. It was not so easy to keep up with him. It was snowing and the umbrellas made it difficult at times to keep a clear view of where he was. A navy blue wooly hat bobbing in and out from view. She saw the man turn and enter a hardware store so she followed him in. The shop was not very busy at all.

The security alarm had gone off and a teller had run out into the street after someone.\par \tab 'Probably just kids trying to steal spray paint' he thought to himself.

He looked a little odd with the skirt of the brown duffle coat poking out from the waist band of the raincoat but he didn't seem to care. Beaton bought a sandwich from the bakers and walked back to the bus station eating it as he went. Instead of returning home he caught a bus that was going in the opposite direction.\par \tab  The bus dropped him off a mile or so beyond the village. He crossed the road and climbed a stile that led into a steeply sloping pasture. Some cows were grazing in the corner of the field on a patch of stubbly grass that was exposed beneath the shade of some trees. The path through the field was well used by walkers but was now hidden beneath fresh virgin snow. He passed close to an old pill box that was half hidden in a patch of scraggy bushes. The concrete had blown in places to reveal the rusting steel struts inside its skin. The walls were heavily graffitied, it smelt strongly of piss. As a child he had played inside of the structure. The path wound through and open gate and into another field. The ground was boggy where the cow herd had churned the the mud around a water trough. The standing water in the puddles was frozen solid. The trough contained a milky green block of ice. At the top of the field he followed the line of the hedgerow until he found another stile that led out onto the steep road that ran from the village up to the quarry. The woods were directly opposite him but he continued to climb until he reached the old allotments and the sheds where he had last exited the quarry. The white flakes drifted down steadily and the unpressed snow on the ground was a few inches deep. Patches of brown frozen mud and leaves, churned and rutted, could be seen in those places protected by the canopy of the larger deciduous trees. The rocky ledges of the quarry walls and the tree branches all carried layers of fine snow. The trees in the distance in their muted shades of brown where flecked with fine white strokes as if from the brush of a frantic painter. The scene was transformed, the bright white snow blanketing the floor made it feel less oppressive and the silent, gentle falling flakes carried an airy feeling of peace and tranquility that was normally missing.\par \tab 'Its like a completely different place now.\rquote  Footprints marked out the trails through the pits. The hollow approach to the mouth of the cave was silent. The pitch black of the cavity, a stark contrast, against the glare of the snow. He ducked into the mine entrance and slid down the slope. \par \tab There was reputed to be a place in the mines known as the Abbey. Beaton had never been there himself but as a young boy growing up it had become a legend amongst himself and his friends. They talked of finding it but were always too afraid to venture very far into the dark. The abbey was rumoured to be at the very heart of the hillside. It was a large cavernous space that had been blasted out of the rock with dynamite. Its walls were sheer and the vaulted ceiling was punctured with a hole where a capstone ought to be. In Beaton's mind the darkness of this megalithic tomb was lanced with a finger of pure white light that flooded in from the world above. Beneath this beam of light was a deep well, chiseled from the rock, it was fed by the spring water that filtered through the valley. The well had once supplied fresh spring water to the miners in the caves and the workers above ground. A bucket was hauled up through the cavern and out through the hole at the top. They had never discovered this breach in the valley side that led to the abbey but it was said to be capped with an iron grill. Tales of the dark magical waters in the deep pool, of wishes made when the moon shone in. Of hermits and creatures that lived and protected the abbey from intruders. Conspiracies of tunnels that led to secret military bunkers built during the cold war. They talked about all of these things with fervour and vivid imagination. Beaton had even remembered talk of a tool that was kept in the village. This tool was used to open a grate inside the mines that would lead to the Abbey. Without the tool it was impossible to reach. As the friends grew older and drifted apart, they lost interest in the mines and its mysteries were past on to a knew generation of children to wonder over. He had found the location when he was in his mid twenties, he was struck how un interesting it was. He figured that was just what growing up was all about. Things just became less exciting.\par \tab All of this Beaton had forgotten but as soon as he had stepped into the woods he remembered everything. His plan was simple. There were two main tunnels leading from the entrance chamber where he now stood. He shone the torch around the chamber and looked at the arrows and symbols sprayed onto the rock.\par \tab 'These routes mean nothing to me and anyway, how can I be sure that they are accurate. They could be misleading. I will have to make up my own routes' His plan was to map out each of the tunnels, making sure to always follow the line of the wall to his left. It was something he had remembered being told about mazes and it seemed logical, to himself at least, that this technique would work in an underground labyrinth. For Beaton, this methodical way of thinking made the task at hand seem somewhat less daunting. He stashed some of the spare gas canisters from his bag behind a rock along with his new raincoat. He took the garden cord and tied the free end to a large tree root that had been dragged into the cave and half burnt.\par \tab 'This will be my lifeline to the outside world'. With the torch in his left hand and the twine over his right shoulder he unreeled the slack from the great spool he was holding and stepped forward into the deepening warren of darkness. \par \tab Emma now knew where to find him next should she want to. Now that she was sure in her mind that it was not by coincidence that she had found the man in the quarry. She had seen him lying in the same position on the very same spot she had discovered her dead child. Then the very next day, she had seen this stranger again. She had followed him into a shop only to see him holding in his hands a blue rope. That blue rope, the same rope that had broken, that had snapped and sent Jonathan falling to his death. No that could not simply have been a coincidence. These things spoke directly to Emma. They formed logical patterns in her grief stricken mind. \par \tab 'There is meaning behind these symbols.\rquote  she told herself. 'I cannot ignore them, to ignore them is to ignore my Jonathan.\rquote \par \tab This was the way she rationalised a world without her son. She had done so for years. It was the reason she still lived and walked in the shadow of the quarry. Her cheeks hollowed thin from over a decade of worrying, reliving that day, every day. Over and over, and her living here, with her husband still healthy, alive whilst Jonathan lay buried in the ground. Her living was an abomination against her sons memory. No parent should ever experience the death of a child, it is opposed to all natural laws. \par \tab She grabbed her umbrella and scarf from behind the door and told her husband that she was going out to post some }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid1986307 Christmas}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid14838232\charrsid615944  cards. It was an excuse that was designed for herself. It was barely even acknowledged by her Husband. Mike was busy helping the delivery man move the steel beer barrels from off of the lorry and down into the basement. She left Kaiser at home in the warm. She could have done with the company but he was an old man now and his back legs had started to cause him pain. It would have been selfish to drag him out into the snow and the cold. Besides, Kaiser didn\rquote t seem to like the Quarry either. Jonathan had help raise Kaiser from when he was just a puppy and they had gone everywhere with each other. He had been with Jonathan on the day of the accident and was probably the only witness to what actually took place that day. He was certainly the last living creature to see Jonathan alive. It was therefore not so strange then that the dog did not always seem to enjoy his walks through those woods up on the hill.\par \tab There was an open bed lorry parked a little way up the road. Two men where shovelling brown grit from the back of it and raking it across the ground. She walked past the post office and the primary school.\par \tab \lquote I used to meet Jonathan at those gates\rquote , She thought to herself, \lquote He hated it when I did.

It\rquote s as if fate or God or something is outguessing you at every turn.\rquote  \par \tab She went on this way in her head as she walked up the hill. Oft times she was distracted by these long moments of thought. A place, a word, or a feeling could carry her away from the present and into meandering avenues of thought. She passed the allotments which she had once tended when they first moved to the village. Memories of small grubby hands pulling out clumps of radishes from the loose black soil.\par \tab \lquote He said it was like finding treasure, couldn\rquote t pronounce his r\rquote s, little dear. Wadishes, he would call them. Wed wadishes.

She knew every path through the wooded Quarry and even under it\rquote s blanket of snow she found her way easily. \par \tab \tab \lquote Those must be his tracks.\rquote \par \tab She followed them into the rock amphitheater and approached the mouth of the cave. She daren\rquote t look up. She knew what was hanging there and she daren\rquote t look up. She knew that under the snow was the exact spot where her child had fallen when she had cut him down. She had sat there many times and cried. It was easier to pass over with the snow to hide it. The footsteps disappeared with the snow. A  slope of loose rock stones and grit led down into the entrance chamber of the mine. She ducked under and slid into the cave. She stood stark still and listened. There was nothing.\par \tab \lquote I know your in here, I know.\rquote  As her eyes adjusted to the darkness she looked about. \tab There was no obvious sign that anyone had been there recently. Someone had gathered together a fire in the middle of the floor but the large gnarled stump was damp and partially charred. She walked the perimeter of the chamber around the central hearth to see if there was something she had missed.  Her head was raised, scanning the walls and the ceiling of the cave for clues. Unable to raise her foot to take a step, ensnared in something caught around her legs, Emma came crashing to the floor, stopping herself on her hands and her knees, letting out a short sharp scream. \par \tab It was his view that he had been making good progress with his plan but the twine had been a bad idea. He did not have nearly enough of it and it was fast running out. He was fast reaching the point where he would have to make a decision. To tie the twine up and come back with more or to abandon the lifeline and continue without it. It had so far been a source of comfort to him and had helped him to keep going. Knowing that behind him there was a line that led straight out into the light. The air in the tunnel was stale. There was a coldness that seemed to creep right into your clothes and stay there. He regretted not having his raincoat on him. The tunnels were mainly wide, big enough to fit a car down but the floor was strewn with large boulders and rocks that had come crashing down from above. Some of the walls look slick with wet. Small pink stalactites hung from the limestone like frozen earth worms. Several of the side tunnels had collapsed completely. It was frightening to think of the sheer weight that was pressing down from above. At certain strategic places the roof had been jacked up by the engineers with wooden props. It was a testament to their skill and hard work that they still helped to keep the mine shafts open. Still, the thick black timber jambs looked as if they might crumble if prodded too hard.\par \tab \lquote This mine is like me in more ways than one. I feel like all my props are slowly crumbling away. At some point my world is going to come crashing down around me.\rquote  \tab Beaton pulled the blanket from his bag and spread it across a large rock in a niche cut from a wall. He tied the end of the twine onto a rusted chisel head he had found and rammed it into the ground. He cut the twine and stuffed the ball into his duffle coat pocket. Wedging the handle of the torch between two rocks so that the beam was cast up towards the ceiling he set about assembling the camping stove on the floor at his feet. He twisted the dial on its side and heard the sound of the gas hissing from the valve. He took out the box of matches and after striking it several times a flame sputtered into life. Touching it to the crown of the camping stove a steady ring of blue flame sprang up. He took the can opener and started to work the mechanism around the rim of a tin of ravioli.\par \tab \lquote Maybe I am having a nervous breakdown. I\rquote ve read about thinks like this.

It wasn\rquote t something that he was aware of even doing at first but for some reason it was easier to do here, alone in the dark. His voice bounced and echoed around the cave walls like the thoughts bouncing inside his skull. He felt quite comfortable sitting in his stone niche.

These tunnels had been cut out years before Beaton was alive and they would exist years after he was gone. There was something frightening but also reassuring about that. He poured out a cup off coffee from the thermos, it wasn\rquote t as hot as he would have liked but the warmth felt good inside of him. Picking the things up from the blanket he put them all back into the rucksack and pulled the blanket around him. Using one of the blankets corners for protection, he picked up the hot tin and forked hot lumps of ravioli into his mouth. When all of them were gone he drank down the tomato sauce. When he was finished he wedged the empty tin can into a crack in the wall. He wiped his mouth on the blanket covering his shoulder and huddled into his corner with another cup of coffee cupped in his hands beneath the blanket. He sat like that for some time staring up at the ceiling where the torchlight was framing a portion of the rock. He was already tired from the past two days he had not slept much and the cold damp air made him feel weary. After a while he ceased to watch and with his eyelids flickering shut his head fell forward and he was asleep. He felt snug inside the small space made between the space of his pulled in knees and his hunched over shoulders. His hot shallow breath and the steam from the coffee warm against his face.\par \par }\pard \ltrpar\qj \li0\ri0\sl-320\slmult0\nowidctlpar\tx566\tx1133\tx1556\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0\pararsid16453515 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid14838232\charrsid615944 \tab It was a bleak and desolate scrubland. The scorched black earth was peppered with the charred black straws of the burnt meadow. The baked ground stretched as far as the eye could see. His legs moved beneath him picking a route between the burnt clumps of grass that stuck up like roasted pin cushions, his feet were shoeless bleeding and sore. His skin was streaked with the greasy black sweat marks from the falling dust and cinders that drifted in a vast cloud above the valley. He had no plan, no direction, his only thought was to flee the burning red glow, that even now so far behind, still warmed his neck and shoulders. He rested against the blackened stump of a tree. Its charcoaled flesh, pared open, cracked and cubed by the intense heat. He knew that everyone must be gone, nothing could have survived and yet he was still alive. There was a low flat building up ahead, he hadn\rquote t seen it at first because it was half set into the side of a low depression in the landscape. As the ground sloped downwards he was able to walk out onto it\rquote s rooftop. The building was round, there was a square hatch cut into the centre of the thick concrete with metal rungs leading down. Leaning over the edge he peered inside the bunker. Small eyelets in the wall let a little light filter through into the chamber. The floor glistened with a thin layer of slurry, a mixture of blast dust and drowned out embers. He didn\rquote t go in, he had found enough scattered teeth and pieces of charred bone to know what he would find no one inside. He rounded the side of the building, the hard packed earth dropped away like steps that led to a stretch of pebbles and a winding sandbank. The dry dirt crumbled and sheared away beneath his feet as he slid into the river bed. The water had boiled away leaving a white crusted tide mark. A ghost of a river now gone. He followed the path of the river bed, keeping to the shadows cast down from the valley side, coveting the left bank. He meandered this way for quite a time. He was thirsty, his lips parched and blistered, his tongue dry and swollen. Soon he was not even aware of his surroundings he was moving over the landscape like a wind blown spec. He knew that the end must be near at hand but it was the deep rooted instinct for survival that kept his soul and his body attached by that thin golden thread.\par \tab It was a small pale hand that rested in his palm. It tugged and pulled at his arm, encouraged him to stand. He followed the child where he was led, it did not concern him or feel strange that this Golden haired boy, dressed in white robes, should have rescue him from near death. He walked, eyes closed and head bent, the child\rquote s hand like a cool pebble resting in his hand. The gentle tug on his arm reassuring him that he was safe. They walked in this manner for some time. When he opened his eyes again they were approaching a cliff of black volcanic rock. Rough steps had been cut away and led up to a wide plateau. Once upon the mesa, the silent barefooted child ran on ahead. The young boy motioned at him to follow as he disappeared from view. Confused at first by the vanishing apparition, he walked to where the boy had beckoned him and saw steep steps leading down into the bowels of the black clastic rock. He passed through the deep cut in the escarpment and came to a large bright room. The child was waiting at the bottom of the stairs for him. They were standing in an immense room as large as a hangar or a warehouse. It was lined from floor to ceiling with white rectangular tiles and it was so bright inside as to be painful on the eyes. There was no obvious source to this white light which reached every corner of the expanse. Small partitions at even spaces ran along two opposite walls. In the middle of the floor was a dividing barrier about six feet in height, like something you might find in the centre of a shower room. It appeared to act as a screen to obscure the view of the opposing cubicles. In each separate station stood a man. Each man pulled on a heavy manacle, the links as large but thicker than a horseshoe. One end of the chain was shackled around a wrist whilst the other end disappeared into a round hole in the facing wall. These tethers appeared to run over and above their heads to be met by the hands of another man standing fettered to the opposing wall. As they pulled on their irons as if in a tug of war, a tension was created in the air above them. The chains running in parallel lines across the length of the ceiling were like the beams of a roof. Suspended, as if on a colossal hammock, was an immense wooden purlin. He couldn\rquote t see for sure but he knew somehow that its surface was carved, like a totem pole, with hideous monsters. The ancient chiseled wood the colour of burnt umber. Its skin tattooed with the faces of ghastly medieval gargoyles, intense, winding and frightening in its unnatural intricacy. It hovered above, an idol to be feared and worshipped. The child led the man to an empty station. The slack coiled links of the chain on the floor looked too heavy to lift. \lquote Where am I ?\rquote  he asked. \lquote What is this place to which you have brought me?\rquote  The child, with a serene smile stretched across his white teeth, closed his eyes and stood like that for a few seconds. He had not said a word to the man since he had met him at the river bed. \par \tab \lquote This is hell\rquote  laughed the cherubim \lquote  and hell will be your new home.\rquote    \par \par \tab It was the scream that woke him. A high pitched screaming noise. Opening his eyes seemed to have little effect it was as dark with them open as it was with them shut. Maybe he had dreamt the scream altogether. He felt disorientated and frightened. His crotch was wet, he stood up banged his head. The cup in his lap clattered on the floor and was lost. He was in a cold sweat and he felt feverish. The nightmare had been vivid. It took him a while to remember where he was. He waited for his eyes to adjust but the only light came from the orange pin prick of the dying torch bulb. The anaemic glow of the metal filament waning. He must have slept for some time for the batteries to have died. He reached down and felt for the torch handle. He pulled it out from between the rocks . Unscrewing the back he felt the two large cylinders slide from the tube into his hand. Gripping the torch between his legs he felt for the canvas bag, his hand sifting through piles of dust and rubble.\par \tab \lquote Where are you, where are you damn it?\rquote  His other hand spilt the batteries and the screw cap they were holding. \lquote Fuck.\rquote  He hissed the word then froze, still, like a statue.

She bowed her head to fit into the recess in the rock.\par \tab \lquote This is a good place as any to wait.\rquote \par \tab She reached out her left hand to steady her self as she crouched into a more comfortable position. Her hand came to rest on something soft, not expected. she pulled it back quickly and loosing balance tried again. Her fingers pressed against the soft flesh. She felt the hard angular bone resisting underneath the skin. Her mouth sucked in air but she failed to scream. She was sprung from the ledge and she was falling, falling, down towards the ground. A flash of white light exploded behind her eyes as her head was jacknifed sideways, wrenched away from her right shoulder as her head hit the floor. The neck folding cockeyed underneath her body with a load cracking sound.\par \par \tab Maybe it had been the confusion of waking from the dream combined with the feeling of a separation from his senses cause by his isolation in that darkness. Whatever the reason, it appeared to Beaton that his fantasy was being fulfilled.\par \tab \lquote It was just as I had imagined it would happen, like in the darkness of the train carriage with the people at my mercy, not knowing I was there.\rquote  \par \tab It was as if this body, this life was given to him in the darkness, a gift from God. He shoved at the body in front of him. He heard it fall to the ground, there was a bright snapping noise like the sound of a dry branch being broken under foot. Frantically patting at the floor blindly with his hands till he found a large piece of stone. He felt along the body till he reached the face, bringing the rock down, once, twice, three times. He slipped his hands around the neck but he could feel from the jutting bone, that the neck was already broken. There was no point in throttling what was already dead. He sat panting on all ours above the body, he felt spent. It was not a sexual feeling he did not feel aroused by the thought or the act of killing. It was the feel of a life beneath his hands that excited him, not death. That he had the choice to give or to take but it was always more satisfying to take. When the adrenalin had left him cold he searched the ground for the twine that led the way out of the cave. He pulled it taught in his left hand and holding out his right arm, began to feel for the wall to steady his way.  At times he scrambled like an animal on all fours when at points the surface of the cave became to rocky to run across. Even when he had seen the dull light of the entrance chamber ahead he did not slow down. Only after he had climbed the loose dirt bank and was out into the open did he collapse onto the ground to pause for breath. His mind was reeling, he was in a state of utter confusion.

He had no idea what exactly had happened at the quarry, and he could do little to explain how the police could have become involved so quickly. The more he drank the less sense it made and the less sense it made the more he felt inclined to drink until at last, overcome, he finally slept. \par \par Thursday 22nd\par \par \tab His back was stiff and he was frozen through from the cold. He still felt a little drunk from the whiskey, he took the bottle in his lap and threw it towards the far wall. He hugged himself and tried to rub some warmth into his cold flesh. It seemed that waking up in the freezing cold dark was becoming something of a regular habit. The translucent powdering of snow at the base of the door created a pale blue bar of light. Lying on his side, he scooped a hole into the snow with his right hand. It made his fingers numb so stuffed his hand into the crook of his arm pit until the feeling returned. Leaning on his left shoulder he peered through the hole. He could see the fences and the upper stories of the neighbouring houses. Above their rooftops he could make out a scrap of blue sky. He decided that he wouldn\rquote t move until he had at least formulated some kind of plan. He knew that he wasn\rquote t going to go back into the house. The police were sure to come back to speak with him and he was keen to avoid them until he at least had some idea about what they wanted. He was hungry too, he couldn\rquote t remember his last square meal. \lquote I\rquote ll go back to to the Quarry.\rquote  The idea seemed like sheer madness at first but the more he mulled it over the more it made sense to him. \lquote I got food and heat there and at least I can see if the police have found the body.\rquote  The body, he half hoped that it was not going to be there at all but he knew that of all things he might be called, delusional was not one of them. He remembered vividly, the feel of the broken neck beneath the soft skin of the throat. He continued to lie on his side staring at the sky and seeing as though no better ideas were coming to mind he decided to go with only half decent one that he had. Like a fox leaving its den, he pulled himself free from the gap beneath the door and dusted himself down. It was a bright morning and there were a quite a few people up and about on the street. Beaton reckoned that it must have been a Thursday. Time had become a little jumbled lately.\par \par \tab The old canal was filled to its brim with fine a powdery snow. A sunken depression in the surface was the only indication as to where the tow path ended and the dried up watercourse began. Nobody had been here since yesterday the path was unspoilt beneath a good few inches of snow. The thick white clumps stuck to his trousers and piled up around his ankles as he waded through. A robin chirruped from a tree top and bounced weightlessly from one fine limb to the next. It settled on a pale brown stalk of dried cow parsley that was perforating the surface of the snow. Jerking its tiny head around like a clockwork toy its tiny black eyes drank in the starving landscape. It flew towards the woods, bobbing and weaving and was gone. Hungry cold, and confused by its first winter. \lquote Do birds ever think that their world is coming to an end?\rquote  Beaton wondered to himself.\par \par \tab Under the tangled canopy of the copse the snow was less dense and Beaton climbed the rutted track that led up towards the meadow. From the high valley ridge he looked down on the town that was steeped in a blessed white. It was a beautiful sight to behold. He sat beneath a yew tree on a collapsed dry stone wall and listened to the church bell of St Steven\rquote s. They chimed eight times and he looked at his watch. He set the dial to the hour and wound the spring. The tiny needle jerked into life and slowly did its rounds beneath the shattered dome. \lquote I suppose that its not such a strange thing to think but the town looks better when you can\rquote t see it anymore.\rquote   He gulped in deep mouthfuls of fresh cold air that made his eyes water. It was a peaceful spot, but his thoughts became drawn to the body beneath the meadow and he started back on his way. From the meadow he returned to the the Quarry and the shadow of its surrounding trees. He had to be careful not to get too close to the edge of the bluff. Great protuberances of fresh snow clung to the overhangs ready to fall. It was difficult to see what was solid ground and what wasn\rquote t. The boulder field below the cliff face was as silent as the grave. The tops of the white rocks that poked free from the snow were painted by the lichen with splashes of yellow and pale green. They lay scattered and strewn about, half sunken higgledy piggledy rows like bleached mussel shells on a beach.\par \par \tab He found his raincoat and the spare gas canisters where he had last left them, behind the rock. The twine was still tied onto the root system of the old dead tree stump. It was just the way he had left it. He picked up the twine. This simple piece of string that was  connecting his past to his future. He certainly didn\rquote t want to face up to the reality of his situation but Beaton reasoned that not knowing would ultimately be worse far. At least he could make informed decisions about what had done. He followed the line until he reached the end that was tethered to the ground by the old chisel. It\rquote s rusted head was still firmly rammed into the hard earth. Feeling his way, he climbed into the niche on the large flat rock which was covered by the old blanket. Kneeling forward, his body craning over the edge  towards the floor, he gently patted the ground from left to right to try and find his missing things. He found the screw cap to the torch handle and put it in his pocket. All the while he kept his eyes screwed tight, as if pretending that it wasn\rquote t really dark at all. His hand fell on something rubbery, it was rounded on one side and flat on the other. He squeezed it, it felt like squeezing a tennis ball except it wasn\rquote t a tennis ball because there was something hard inside of it. He leaned a little forward and tried to gauge the size of the object. It kept getting bigger and bigger. Once he had made out the heel and put his hands around the ankle he knew for sure what he had found. He fell backwards, pushing himself into the wall away from the body. He was breathing hard, his initial thought was to start running again but  he knew that he could not. Beaton sat and thought, he thought and thought and thought until his head was hurting. \lquote The police, they must not know yet. They wouldn\rquote t leave a body here, but what did they want then? Maybe work had rung them, told them I was missing. Yes that must be it. Nobody must know about this yet. But soon, but soon someone will be missing and then they will start looking.\rquote  Beaton started to think about who could be lying on the floor in front of him. If he looked then he could know for sure but he couldn\rquote t face the thought of seeing the face. In his fantasies the body had always been faceless. He did not feel the need to know. \lquote Maybe its just an old vagrant who lives down here, someone that no one will miss.\rquote \par \tab After some time he eased himself from the ledge and stood. He lightly used his foot to kick along the edge of the body to see where exactly it was lying. He Picked up the blanket and laid it over the body and sat back down. Covering the body had not made him feel any better. \lquote Your going to have to do more than that Beaton\rquote . He searched for the canvas bag and once he had found it he replaced the batteries in the torch. The legs of the body from the knee down protruded from under then end of the blanket. It looked comical in a weird way like the whole thing was a bad joke and the person might suddenly sit up. A weird wave of excitement washed over Beaton at the sight of the corpse. He started to clear the rocks around the body until he had cleared a wide flat space. Switching the torch off again he pulled away the blanket so it was lying on the clear floor alongside the body. He tried to lift the dead weight with his foot and roll it onto the blanket but it wouldn\rquote t budge. He crouched down and grabbed two handfuls of material, he was trying his damnedest not to feel the person underneath the clothing. He heaved the thing over and felt what must have been an arm, flop onto his foot. He kicked it off, it felt as dead and stiff as length of driftwood. The cadaver was now lying part way on the blanket. Beaton was now able to roll the body over, wrapping it round several times. He took from the canvas bag the length of nylon blue rope and unrolled it. He measure out two arm spans of rope and with the matches melted the chord. He did this several times until he had four shorter lengths to work with. He lifted the legs and placed a slip knot over them and pulled it tight. He wound the remaining chord around the slipknot and tied two half hitches into the loop. He did this three more times along the length of the body, trussing it like a butchers ham. When he pulled tight the last slip knot he felt the rope slip from the corpses head and tighten quickly around its neck. He put his hand out to feel where the end of the blanket was. His hand touched the face, it was cool and waxy. The blanket was now pulled down away from the face leaving the whole of the head exposed. Beaton tried to pull the blanket up some more but it was bound so tight that it wasn\rquote t budging. His hand became entangled in a mass of loose curls. The hair entangling his fingers. He pulled his hand away quickly, there was some ripping as the follicles tore free from the scalp. He shook his hands wildly and pulled at his fingers to remove the hair.  \lquote It\rquote s definitely a woman. I\rquote ve killed a woman. What the hell was she doing down here anyway?\rquote  He sat back on to the floor. \lquote There\rquote s still time to sort this out.\rquote  He emptied out the canvas rucksack onto the floor and pulled it over the dead woman\rquote s head. He pulled the drawstrings and tied it around her neck. It took all his remaining strength to pull the body onto the ledge and push it against the wall. He slowly began to cover it with stones, he worked without torch light, methodically stacking the rocks. In an hour he had completely covered the body. Outside in the entrance chamber to the mine he cooked a meal and tried his best to think about what his next move should be. He had killed a woman and now he had hidden her body.\par \par \tab Hollis Bergan returned to twenty three Glovers Lane the following morning. She rang the door bell but as she had predicted, there was nobody in. She knocked on Mrs Gream\rquote s door but there was no answer there either. She walked around the back to the garages. She noticed that one of them was partially opened. The snow around the door had been kicked up and there were footprints leading to and from the entrance way. \lquote So that\rquote s where you stayed last night is it\rquote  She pulled the door as high as it would go. The door had come off of its runners and only lifted on the springs half way up. Hollis ducked inside, there was a pallet on the floor and an empty wooden shelf against the back wall. It smelt like foxes had been living inside there at one time. Against one wall was the broken stem of a bottle. She lifted it up, the label holding the small shards together, it still smelt strongly of whiskey. She went through the back gate and in to the house through the kitchen door. Nothing had changed noticeably since the night before. There was a freestanding cupboard by the door with a telephone on top. Inside were a stack of telephone books, Thompson directories and  yellow pages, nothing unusual. She opened the top drawer. There was a small red book with the words \lquote Addresses\rquote  stamped across its cover in faded gilt lettering.  She sat down at the kitchen side table and leafed through a few of the pages before putting it into her breast pocket. She stood up and went to the living room. Picking up the photo on the mantle piece, she turned it over and twisted the two small brass plates on the black velveteen backing and removed the cover. She took out the photograph\rquote , there was something written on it. \lquote Amsterdam August 1991\rquote   She put the photograph inside the cover of the little red Address Book and tucked it away again. She headed back to the station to make some further line of enquiry and to organise sealing of the house.\par \par \tab \lquote Good morning, PCI Limited.\rquote  The voice was bright and perky.\par \tab \lquote Oh hello, I wonder if you could help me.

Then at 2:15, just after lunch, Steve told her that somebody had just come into the station to file a missing persons report.\par \par \tab \lquote I\rquote m so cold\rquote  he thought. The warmth from the fire was eaten up immediately by the freezing air around him. The only good thing about being frozen was that it had taken his mind off of things. He squatted by the smoking embers, the wood was damp and hissed. Great plumes of thick grey smoke wafted about and stung his eyes. The water boiled and bubbled in white froth, steaming from the surface of the sodden fibres. He watched the woodlice scurry to escape, like doomed passengers on a sinking ship, they converged at the ends of the burning branches before falling into the sea of hot fire. \lquote How long can I stay hidden up here. I have to get warm.\rquote  Long icicles had started to form over the entrance of the mine. They shone and glinted in the sunlight. He had eaten all the food and used up half of his supply of gas. He wound his watch and checked the time, it was approaching two o\rquote clock. He stood up and picked up the raincoat he had been using as a cushion. He pulled it on over his duffle coat and stepped out into the forest. His body stumbled in jerky erratic movements, the cold stretched itself into every corner of his body. His jaw shuddered and his teeth chattered uncontrollably.  He had lost the feeling in his feet, if he had removed his boots and walked bare foot through the snow he would not have noticed the difference. \tab Before going into the pub, Beaton cupped his hand over the glass of the window pain and peered in. There was no fire burning in the pub. The embers in the hearth had been raked clean and swept away leaving just the cold black cast iron grate and the scorched red fire bricks at the back. Beaton was disappointed but it was still warm inside. Beaton hovered in the doorway beating his hands together and stamping his feet. The pub looked empty of customers. The pins and needles began to creep back into his fingers.\par \tab \lquote Cold enough for you is it.\rquote \par \tab Beaton looked up, there was a young man standing at the bar, Beaton had not seen in him before.

He stuffed his left hand between the radiator and the old the peeling stiff folds of the anaglypta wallpaper. It began to burn but it felt good, he swapped hands. He pretended to read the paper, taking tiny sips from his glass to make it last. It was not long until he had fallen asleep. When he woke. it was getting dark outside, he checked his watch and wound it. It was a quarter past four. He had not been asleep for long. There were a few people in the pub. He recognised the man who had spoken to him in the toilets. He was sitting alone at the bar drinking. The young barmen was preparing the fire in the grate for the evening, twisting and knotting sheets of newspaper and stacking them in the grate like a wigwam. Two old ladies occupied the booth in front, they gossiped greedily over their tall glasses of ruby port, engrossed. Beaton got up and went to the gents. He sat in the cubicle but he was constipated and couldn\rquote t go. He spooled off about half the roll of toilet paper and put it in his pocket for later. He ran his hands under the hot tap and stared at himself in the mirror. He hardly recognised himself. He looked like a castaway. His face was gaunt and rawboned, his eyes were ringed and bruised looking. The long bristles on his face made him look slightly crazed. He took off his hat and threw water on his face. He tried his best to straighten himself out before leaving. He took his empty glass to the bar, the barman stopped what he was doing and served him another, returning afterwards to finish the fire. The man drinking at the bar said\par \tab \lquote Hello\rquote .\par \tab \lquote Hello.\rquote  \lquote We met the other night, right?

Not born here mind you.\rquote  Finn wittered away like this at length about nothing and everything facing the same way as Beaton, looking out across the pub floor. Finn noticed that Beaton was staring at the great Alsatian dog who was standing beneath the hatch that led behind the bar. Desperate to seize on any subject that might hold the interest of his newly found confidant Finn whistled loudly in the air . He thrust his arm in the direction of the dog and rubbed his thumb and fingers together making a sort of tutting\rquote  noise with his tongue on the roof of his mouth.\par \tab \lquote Kaiser, here boy, c\rquote mere Kaiser Boy\rquote .\par \tab The dog sniffed the ground at its feet sheepishly and skulked over to the two men sitting at the table.

His head was pounding. He cradled it in his hands, tried to squeeze it to force himself to think clearly. Finn was saying something to him but he wasn\rquote t listening. He sat with his chin resting on the table top, both his hands folded atop of his head. He stared at the finger of flame flicker around the paper as the fire took. What was he going to do. The police wold come, they would come with dogs. They would search the quarry. They would find the body. Beaton lifted his gaze from fireplace and rested it on the large rusting bucksaw that hung from the chimney piece.

It was a long walk up to the quarry and along the meadows that skirted the valley side. The journey from his old home to the quarry had become a regular pilgrimage for him. And it did feel like it was his old home. He knew that things had changed forever, that he would not be allowed to go back to his old job. He was desperate to break free from what his life had become and for better or for worse he had done that. The woman\rquote s body in the quarry would always be there, no matter what he did. Even if he had buried her in the deepest darkest hole, she would always be present in his mind from one waking day to the next. he seemed to be stepping back from a normal way of life. Creeping backwards into the shadow of the mines. Rubbing away the layers of himself until all that would be left was a phantom, a spectre that lived in the quarry on the hill. Down through the woods and past the old canal back out on to the streets of the town.\par \par \tab Beaton skirted around to the row of garages behind the terrace. He unlatched the gate and snuck into his own back garden. The moon reflected from the rooftops, a cold slate blue halation projected onto the tiles. The snow glowed bright amongst the shadows with an unnatural luminescence. His house looked strange, foreign. The water butt had been pushed back into place but the glass louvre panels were still on the ground covered by a thin layer of snowfall. The hole in the window had been boarded up with a sheet of chipboard. He looked at the window. It didn\rquote t seem like his home at all. He couldn\rquote t get into the house, his keys were still upstairs. He crept into the potting shed and sat down on a bag of compost. Inside smelt of cut pine and creosote, spiders webs clustered around the shelves and spun confused webs around the stacks of terracotta plant pots. The window panes were clouded with grime, they let in the light but it was impossible to actually look in or out. He leaned his back against the wall and stretched out his legs and he felt the cold air creeping through the gaps in the loose boards. He sat like that through the night barely managing to catch a few hours of sleep. \par \par Friday 23rd\par \par \tab He watched the dark blue sky fade into a pale brown haze. The sun climbed as far as it could manage and settled itself low in the sky. In a black bucket besides the door was a roll of heavy duty rubble sacks and some gardening gloves. He picked them up and put them in his pocket. From a small hook on the wall, he took down a compass saw. There was a small crack in the orange plastic and the blade was flecked with spots of rust but other than that it seemed to be in good shape. He opened the door and threw it onto the lawn. From the shelf he picked up a pair of secateurs. He unlocked the catch and tested the spring mechanism. He put them in his pocket with the rubble sacks. \lquote I\rquote ve go to hide the saw\rquote , He thought, \lquote It wouldn\rquote t look right to be carrying it around in the open\rquote   He found an old nylon duffle bag stuffed under the shelf. He pulled it out, it was heavy. Inside were some old bicycle tools. He brought the bag out into the garden and emptied the contents onto the ground. He put away the saw with the rubble sack and pruning scissors leaving a scattered pile of odds and ends.\par He had his hand on the latch ready to leave the garden when he heard the sound of a metal bolt sliding from a socket and a key turning in its lock. In the doorway at the top of the steps stood Mrs Gream. In her hands she held a basket of clean washing ready for hanging on the clothes line. They stood there, stock still. As if one were waiting for the other to make the first move. It was Mrs Gream that took the initiative. Whether she had meant to or not was another matter. The washing basket fell from her arms and rattled down the steps spilling the fresh white sheets on to the patio. Beaton hurled the duffle bag over the fence and vaulted after it. He stumbled from the flower beds and fell to the ground, next to him was a small stone tortoise, the kind of thing you find in a garden centre. He grabbed it by its shell and picked it up. Mrs Gream let out a scream and ran back into her house slamming and locking the kitchen door. Beaton thrust the heavy base of the concrete statue through the glass. He heard the old lady hollering from inside the kitchen and saw Mrs Gream dash into the hallway. Beaton batted the loose shards of glass from around edge of the window and reached inside he unlocked the door. He ran through the kitchen and grabbing the newel post he swung around in an arc pulling himself onwards and up the staircase. He stood panting on the landing leaning hard on the hand rail. On the floor above the skirting board was the telephone socket. The cable followed the edge of the carpet and disappeared under the nearest door. He reached down and delicately unclipped the lead from the wall socket and heard a suppressed whimper from inside the room.\par \tab \lquote Mrs Gream, Mrs Gream, I just want to talk\rquote \par \tab His hand resting on the handle he slowly opened the door. It opened easily, it wasn\rquote t locked. He could hear a low sobbing. Mrs Gream was kneeling  behind the bed with her head hung down, she held the telephone in her hands.\par \tab \lquote It\rquote s me Mrs Gream, It\rquote s your neighbour Beaton.\rquote \par \tab \lquote What do you want, Go away, leave me alone\rquote  She began sobbing again.\par \tab Beaton sat down on the bed the concrete stone tortoise resting in his lap. She stopped looking like a little old lady and looked more like a little girl kneeling for her bedtime prayers. \tab \lquote Who were you phoning Mrs Gream? Was it the police?\rquote  Did you call them before?\rquote   She didn\rquote t answer, she just gave out the same low suppressed sobs. \par \par \tab Beaton stood and pulled the blanket from the bed and threw it over Mrs Gream. It covered her completely like a shroud over a statue. Muffled sobs continued to come from beneath the cover.  He sat back down the stone tortoise resting in his lap as if he might be contemplating what his next move might be. He stood up all of a sudden and held the concrete garden ornament by its pointy hat above Mrs Gream\rquote s head. He turned his head away and looked out of the window, down into the garden, there was a squirrel eating from a bird feeder. It swung wildly upside down, its tail bobbing and ticking maniacally. He screwed his eyes tight shut and felt the heavy weight slip through his grip, it was followed by a thud and the sobbing suddenly ceased.  The squirrel was still swinging upside down from the little mesh cage, a magpie screamed from a tree top. When he looked down, Mrs Gream was slumped sideways, the red was soaking through the bed cover, seeping into the fabric like blotting paper. He lifted the cover and threw it aside. Her face was slack, the loose skin around her jaw hung about in loose flaps like a turkeys wattle. Her short her was matted with the wet blood that still pooled into the bed cover beneath her head. Her left eyelid was partly open but he could only see a slice of white inside the socket. Beaton crouched down and rolled over the old lady\rquote s body so she was face downwards on the carpet. Mrs Gream\rquote s breathing was soft and shallow almost imperceptible. Beaton stood up unbuckled his belt and slid it from the belt loops. He thread one end of the belt through the frame of the bedstead and feeding it through the buckle he pulled it tight. He looked about the room. He found a knitting bag on the floor by the bedside table. He pulled two needles form the bag and pushed one of the needles through the leather as close to the buckle as possible. He tugged at the buckle to make sure that it was securely attached the bed frame. Picking up the loose end of the belt, Beaton looped it through the telephone chord binding Mrs Gream\rquote s arms and folded it back on itself.  He then staked the two strips of leather together with the second knitting needle.\par \tab The old lady lay on her side tied to the bed frame with her hands behind her back. Beaton went to the dresser and rooted through the drawers. In the bottom drawer he found a balled up pair of brown sheer tights. He unravelled the tights and wrapping it around Mrs Gream\rquote s head he gagged her mouth. He took a pillow from the bed and stripped the cover from it and pulled it over the old lady\rquote s head. From downstairs his pocket he took the ball of garden twine and bound the old lady\rquote s hands tightly behind her back. He went into the bathroom and washed his hands and face. He looked for a razor but there was none, instead finding a pair of scissors. He trimmed the hair on his face as close to the skin as he could manage. He went downstairs and looked through the kitchen cupboards. He found a tin of spaghetti hoops and heated them in a bowl in the microwave and made himself some toast. He sat chewing the meal methodically staring into the happy face of the stone tortoise. From the kitchen he could see down the hallway to the front door with its stained glass. The walls and carpet were illuminated with burning patches of blue and red. He watched the silhouette of the postman come and go, some letters fell through the letterbox and onto the door matt. The house was quiet, peaceful. It was interesting to see his house from another persons perspective. From a room in another persons house. In the garden the squirrel was gone, a magpie sat on a branch above the bird feeder. \lquote One for sorrow\rquote , it was a rhyme that his wife used to say. \lquote One for sorrow, two for joy.\rquote  He put the dirty dishes in the sink and swept up the broken glass from the back door step. From a cupboard he stole a packet of crackers. He shut the door and locked it from the outside, placing the key in his pocket. He picked up his duffle bag and went to the back gate. It was locked. He clambered back over the fence into his own back garden and out into the alleyway past the garages. He looked like any other man who was going to work on a friday morning.\par \par \tab Hollis dropped the boys of at school and drove out of town until she reached the village. She followed the steep road up the hill past the Quarryman\rquote s arms and parked near the old village green at the uppermost corner of the wooded quarry. She leant against the car and looked down across the valley, it had been so long time since she had stood up here. \lquote It must have been when the boys were smaller, much smaller.\rquote  It was impossible to get them out of the house these days. They preferred to stay in and play video games than go out. \lquote When I was young you couldn\rquote t get me to stay inside.\rquote  She thought to herself. She left the car and walked to the gate that marked the top entrance to the Quarry. She followed the tracks that had been made by an early dog walker. The tracks rounded the tops of the quarry pits and left the woods on a pathway through a meadow.  She doubled back into the woods, striking out a new path that followed a steep incline down into a quarry pit. The way down was easy to see and the snow was well trodden and compacted making it slippery and dangerous. Hollis held onto the tree roots to keep herself from sliding. The pitt formed an amphitheatre around and above her head. It was hard not to feel like she were being watched from somewhere, someone behind a tree or a rock. It was an unnerving feeling, the place had a strange atmosphere all of its own that was lost when you stepped outside of the woods.\par \tab There was a cave up ahead, it was cut deep into the base of the cliff face, a black horizontal gash that sucked in all of the surrounding light. There was a slope down through a low entrance way where the cave opened out inside to a large entrance chamber. Hollis kept one hand on the roof of the entranceway, stooping down to look inside. She could make out two tunnels leading from the chamber. In the middle of the space sat a half burnt tree timber surrounded by the usual rubbish you would expect in such a place. She heard some shouts behind her, she turned around to see two boys pass the face of the quarry pit on bicycles. She thought about following them to see why they weren\rquote t at school but as she was not on duty she decided to let it go. She found herself thinking that maybe it was better that the boys didn\rquote t go out so much. \lquote I wouldn\rquote t want them playing around here that\rquote s for sure.\rquote  The cries of the boys and the sound of cracking tree branches ricocheted around the quarry and between the web of trees. She left the quarry on a lower path that led back to the village green where her car was still parked. Hollis got inside and sat with her hands resting on the wheel. She was thinking about the boys she had seen in the wood and she was thinking about the Powell\rquote s kid who had died there. Most of all she was thinking also about her own two children. There was so much in the world you couldn\rquote t protect against. So much that was unforeseen. Maybe it was her fault, maybe she made had made them scared of the world. She had seen enough of it to know the kind of bad things that could go on. She was certainly no stranger to its dangers. She slowly put the key in the ignition and held it there still thinking, then she started the car. The thrum of the engine beneath the bonnet kickstarted her mind again. She put the car in gear and drove down the hill back towards the village.\par \tab Beaton crouched in the snow behind a holly tree, the duffle bag held tightly in his lap. He was watching woman standing in the quarry pit below. He had first seen her along the path from the canal to the woods. He had been in the shadow of the copse about to climb a wooden stile. She had walked out of the quarry along the path across the meadow, had stopped as if lost and then turned back retracing her steps. It seemed at first that she might have seen him but she was not in a hurry and didn\rquote t look concerned. He followed her at a distance and watched her as she made her way down the steep path that wound into into the large pit. He lost sight of her as she approached the base of the quarry face beneath where he was hiding. \lquote What are you looking for?\rquote  He was getting nervous the longer that she was gone from view. He was about to start heading around and down along the edge of the bluff but he stopped. He heard the sounds of shouting, two boys on mountain bikes were weaving through the woods. As they passed in front of the quarry face he saw the woman return. She didn\rquote t look in any way familiar. She wasn\rquote t dressed like a police officer. \lquote Maybe just a random walker. your getting paranoid about things.\rquote  He waited until he was sure she had gone before coming down and around to the mouth of the cave. He quickly looked around the entrance chamber but it appeared nothing had changed much. The green garden twine that led to the gravesite was still wrapped around the root stump.\par \tab He followed the string trail by torchlight until he reached the niche where the stack of stones concealed the dead body. He took his time lifting away the rocks and piling them against the opposite wall. Twenty minutes later he had recovered the body wrapped in its blanket. He rolled the corpse away from the wall so it was in the centre of the slab and dumped the duffle bag next to it. He took out the compass saw, secateurs and the rubble sacks and the gloves. He rolled off one of the sacks, he made a hole in the bottom of the sack and cut two slits at either side. He pulled the make shift apron over his head and put on the gardening gloves and turned off the torch. Feeling along the body with his hands he found the neck and with his left had resting there he reached out and picked up the compass saw. He felt the tug and the snag of the fabric in the teeth of the blade. The blanket made a ripping sound like a cat clawing at the arm of a settee. Then the saw blade took hold of the flesh beneath and he felt the spray of tiny cold droplets hitting his face each time pulled the tool towards him. He leant into the blade, sawing at the dead meat methodically. He remembered how his father had taught him to hold a saw, to let the blade do all the work. To follow through each time, the body a machine driving the tool. The tendons snagged and ripped and it wasn\rquote t long before he had reached the bone. He worked the blade between the cervical vertebrae, it sounded and felt like a hacksaw going through a piece of plastic pipe. \lquote It\rquote s just an old piece of pipe, just a pipe. Nothing but an old piece of plumbing pipe\rquote  The vibration made his hand vibrate and the fingers feel numb. He was hot beneath the plastic sack, it was hard sweaty work. All the time he repeated to himself the same words. \lquote Keep on Beaton, don\rquote t stop Beaton, keep on going, don\rquote t give up\rquote . Over and over, each word spoken to the push and pull, see saw rhythm, the buzz and the zip of the tiny little teeth biting through this thing that he was desperate to hide. Once he had disengaged the head from the body he tied it up inside the canvas bag and dumped it into a rubble sack, knotting it twice at the top. He hadn\rquote t anticipated the work taking him so long. \lquote This is going to take at least several days.\rquote  he thought to himself.\par \tab Beaton contemplated how he was going to divide the body into small enough pieces to carry. \lquote I will just take the head and the arms today, the legs tomorrow and the trunk last.\rquote  He rolled the headless corpse onto its side and propped it with stones. He remove the arm from just below the shoulder, dividing it again at the elbow, just above the joint. He repeated the process on the other side and put both pieces in separate sacks. He put all three sacks into the duffle bag. He left the tools next to the slab with the make shift apron and his gloves. He rolled the body up against the wall, it already felt noticeably lighter, and he covered it again with the rocks. Outside he scrubbed the blood from his face with handfuls of fresh snow. He sat and ate the crackers staring at the reddish brown stains on his knees. He was surprised at how hungry he was, shocked at his capacity to eat after the task he had just performed. When he had eaten all of the crackers he took his duffle bag and left. He still had work to do today. \par \par \par \tab Michael Powell had spent the last few days in a waking dream. He could not focus on any task for more that a few moments without his mind slipping. He couldn\rquote t believe that Emma would have simply up and left him. He knew that whatever the reasons were for her disappearance, running away was not one of them. After all, it was Emma that had insisted on staying in the village after Jonathan had died. It was Mike that had wanted to leave, to get away and make a fresh start. Not Emma. They had not spoken much lately, the pub was a full time job and it kept them both tired enough. They had slipped into their daily routines, both accepting the fact that nothing was going to change now that everything had changed. The police had told him to try and get on with his normal life but his life had, for a long time, seemed far from being normal. There had been times, not long after their son had died, that Emma had gone away. It had never been more than a few days at a time and she always returned. He never asked her where she had gone although he had always suspected that she had gone to her sisters. They had both coped and grieved in their own way. He had never been one for showing or sharing his emotions. He had accepted his sons death and knew that they would not have another. He had been close to Jonathan, they were best buddies and he had always been proud of him. Jonathan was a sweet natured boy, sensitive and popular with the other children at school. Mike had always thought of him as being a little more immature than some of his piers but it was nothing that he wasn\rquote t going to grow out of in time. It was probably just having been an only child, he was imaginative and would play in the woods for hours on end. Emma and Michael could not explain his death. The coroner ruled that the death may have been suicide or accidental death, a game gone badly wrong. Emma would not accept the ruling. She \lquote knew\rquote , that was how she put it. She knew that there was more to the story. She believed that Jonathan had been murdered, she could not face the idea that her boys death could have been an accident or something far worse. She had been the one to find the young boy, hanging by his neck from a tree above the quarry pit. Hanging in the cold dying light of an autumn evening. It had appeared that Jonathan had taken the rope swing and made a noose which he had tied around his neck before stepping from the brink. Kaiser, just a puppy then, was yelping looking up at the weird fruit dangling from the crooked bough above. It was because his wife had \lquote known\rquote  that they had never left the pub, had stayed in the village. He had screamed, begged and pleaded with her to leave but she refused. She had told him she would stay regardless, it was up to him if he would stay with her. He had stayed but ever since the ultimatum the love between them had grown into understanding an acceptance of how things would be.\par \tab Michael had asked Ryan to do double shifts for a while to staff the bar, he didn\rquote t feel up to fraternising yet. Ryan was a good guy, he was understanding to the situation that Mike now found himself in. Besides there was plenty of paperwork that Mike needed to catch up on. That was how Hollis found Mike when she entered the pub. He was sitting at the bar, scratching his head over the accounts, chewing on a pencil nub. Kaiser was dutifully curled around up at the foot of Mikes barstool, he appeared asleep but at a closer glance his squinting eye was keeping watch. \par \tab \lquote What\rquote ll it be\rquote  asked Ryan\par \tab \lquote I\rquote ll have a half of six X please\rquote  Mike looked up, he hadn\rquote t recognised the woman\rquote s voice, he nodded at Hollis when she caught his eye, then he went back to studying the papers.

Don\rquote t worry, It\rquote s Beaton, your neighbour.\rquote  \par \tab His voice was light and cheerful. He turned on the hall light and went upstairs. Mrs Gream was hunched over in a kneeling position with her head bent forward to her chest. There was a dark stain on the carpet, the room reeked of the sweet smell of urine.\par \tab \lquote Oh, shit. I\rquote m sorry I was gone so long.

He brushed past her in the doorway and headed back downstairs.\par \tab \lquote I don\rquote t know about you Mrs Gream but I am famished. Simply starving.\rquote  He took two eggs from the fridge and boiled some water in a pan. He ran the eggs under a hot tap until they were warmed through and placed them gently into the bubbling water carefully using a ladle. He watched the clock on the oven and after two minutes had passed he put the bread into the toaster. Once it had popped up he buttered the toast and cut them into thin strips. He couldn\rquote t find an egg cup so instead he used a small clear drinking glass from the dresser cabinet. With a sharp knife he removed the scalp of the egg. He heavily salted the white flesh before ramming one of the soldier deep into the heart of the egg. A golden yellow rivulet of yolk ran down the side of the glass and pooled on the surface of the saucer.\par \tab \lquote You can\rquote t beat a good egg.

As Mrs Gream\rquote s foot touched down on the step below she bent her body slightly forwards to catch the weight of her body. She swayed and being overbalanced with her hands tied tightly behind her she keeled forward like a freshly felled tree. She made no noise as she dropped. Her right shoulder took the initial brunt of the impact but as her upper body absorbed the blow against the steps her head was snapped forward, cracking loudly against a bannister. She rumbled down the staircase turning once over sidewise, then rolling, head of heels, face downwards her chin bumping, bup, bup, bup from step to step. She came to rest at the bottom of the stairs. Her knees on the hall floor with her legs askew. The pillow case had remained in place but it appeared she was staring up towards the place she had only just been standing. She was still, very still. \par \tab \lquote Mrs Gream, Mrs Gream?\rquote \par \tab Beaton spoke in a hushed voice as if he were waking her from a long nap. He gently shook her by the shoulder. \lquote Mrs Gream.\rquote  He pulled her by the legs, she flopped down the last few steps until she was lying straight along the hallway, her legs towards the front door. He went upstairs and took the soiled sheet from the floor.

What am I going to do with you?\rquote  He dragged her by the feet back into the hall way and down the three small steps that led into the kitchen. He made sure to pull her slowly from step to step to lessen the noise, wump, wump, wump. He winced with each bang of the head, aware that the neighbours next door might be listening. He left her face down on the greasy linoleum and went upstairs to the bedroom. He tidied up, putting his belt back on and made up the bed as best he could. He returned the needles to the knitting bag. In the back of a closet he found a suitcase, the type with little wheels and an extendable handle. He opened it and proceeded to fill it with a jumble of clothes from the dresser. He also threw in the stone tortoise and brought it downstairs. There was still the problem of what to do about the window that had been smashed. He emptied the dustbin into the kitchen sink. He picked out the larger items and put the, back into the dustbin. He sifted through the rubbish in the sink until all that was left were the shards of glass he had swept away from the day before. He took the old ladies coat, scarf and gloves from the closet and and threw them in the suitcase with the stone tortoise and the rest of the clothes. In a draw in the kitchen he found her purse and keys which he stuffed into his pocket. In the living room he put on the television and went to sleep.

He went out into the kitchen and stepped over the body of Mrs Gream. Beaton took the little bunch of keys from his pocket and unlocked the back door. He crept out into the garden. There were no lights on in any of the houses only the small flashing fairy lights strung around a few of the neighbouring windows. He struggled to remove the padlock from the back gate. Disengaging the rusty lock from the hook made so much noise that he had taken a break before dragging open the back gate on it\rquote s sagging hinges. As far as he could tell, no one had heard him. Yet. he made sure there was a clear path from the back door out into the alleyway behind the houses. He pulled open the garage, leaving a gap about knee height. It would be too noisy to force the thing any further. Grabbing Mrs Gream by the ankles he pulled her out into the garden and through the gate leaving her just in front of the Garage entrance. He scuttled under the door like a crab and reaching through the gap he heaved the old lady into the darkness. He dumped her onto the pallet and covered her body with the bed sheet. By morning his tracks would be covered up by the drifts of snow but he made sure to scuff at the drag marks and disturb any obvious signs that he had been there. He couldn\rquote t leave her in the garage, that was certain but until he had dealt with the first body there was little he could do about the second. \par \par \tab Back inside Mrs Gream house, he filled his duffle bag with food from the cupboards. In the living room he found an unopened bottle of 15 year old Ruby Port. A single relic in an otherwise empty drinks cabinet. He removed the glass form the sink and scattered it about the kitchen floor in front of the back door. He locked the door from the outside with the small bunch of keys Searching the garden he found a large stone about the size of his fist. He through it through the empty hole in the window. It clattered to the floor and rolled underneath the table. He left the traveling case and the duffle bag out in the alleyway and locked the gate from the inside. He climbed back over into his garden and out through his back gate into the alley picking up the two bags he made his way back towards the quarry.\par \par \par \tab Hollis wanted to make a few more inquiries before she gave up on trying to find Beaton.

During these maladies he would sometimes sleep walk, speaking nonsense words, laughing and crying, break down in fits of rage. In the morning, young Beaton would be oblivious to his feverish somnambulisms. The only thing he could remember was the same recurring dream which visited him when he was sick. It was more of a feeling, a waking dream experienced from the slipping in and out of an unconscious state. He felt as if he were composed entirely of resonating waves. He was neither separate nor was he a part of his surroundings, everything vibrated as one. Innumerable microscopic glass filaments quivering through time and space. Every nerve in his fevered body alert, quivering. He felt a sensation, a texture. An alien feeling that he had never known in the waking world and which he could not pinpoint. Like the memory of a phantom taste that comes and goes yet can never be recaptured as it once was, if it ever existed at all. It was a sensation, both hard and soft, like fingernails squealing across a backboard. The shiver down a spine. Excitement and nausea, dread and ecstasy. As the feeling intensified the silver threads bounced and zig zagged increasing in size and frequency until the the blurred into a mass of flickering white spots. Like the interrupted signal on a TV screen. The nausea and anxiety grew in ever increasing waves, until Beaton could sense the danger that lurked behind the fractured lines that convulsed and juddered in their spasmodic zig zag patterns. Something black spreading through his brain quake, eating up his soul. This is what he called 'the ugly spirit.' It moved through everything, it was God itself. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid14838232\charrsid16453515 \par }\pard \ltrpar\qj \li0\ri0\sl-320\slmult0\nowidctlpar\tx0\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0\pararsid16453515 {\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\ai\af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\i\fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid14838232\charrsid615944 \par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid14838232\charrsid615944 \tab From the crest}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\ai\af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\i\fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid14838232\charrsid615944  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid14838232\charrsid615944 of the valley Beaton looked down onto the the village, nestled in its hollow.

The street lamps still burned amongst the odd glow from behind a curtained window. Instead of continuing on the path into the quarry Beaton skipped the fence and cut across the field, down towards the village. Skidding and stumbling towards the bottom of the field under the shade of a tangle of bushes and trees. He made a comical sight, flailing down hillside, a bag in each hand. He forced his way through a thicket only to come up against a tall chain link fence. He had forgotten that the railway tracks ran the course of the valley like a river. It would mean back tracking up the hill and around over the top of the tunnel further up the valley. Beaton left the bags by the base of the fence and climbed chain link fence. He landed heavily on the other side, rolling down the steep embankment through the dead sticks of cow parsley and teasels. He picked himself up and looked up and down the track, the steel roads bending out of sight into the depths of the tunnel. He dashed over the gravel, jumping the lines and rushed into the bushes at the base of the opposing bank. He made his way up the slope, pulling himself along with the help of roots and branches. He scaled another fence and found himself standing on the edge of the rec. He passed some abandoned swings and the manicured hedges that enclosed the bowling green. He took a narrow bath that led down to the river and rose again towards the church. The path was dark, with high stone walls on either side, that held back two rows of cypress trees. They hung in the air above him, menacing. The path came out at the back of the old vicarage. It was beginning to get light. The old church yard was peaceful, the flat pedestals of the tombstones, each covered with thick white tablecloth of snow. Through stained glass in the arched window, Beaton could see a light on, he walked around to the other side of the building. He lifted the heavy ring of the great wooden door and felt it click open in a clunky movement. He pushed, it was open. There was a strange smell, it was the smell of the waxed floors and incense. An old, ancient smell too. He hadn\rquote t stepped in a church for so long he couldn\rquote t remember when. He stood for a while in the silence, it was a peaceful place. He dare not walk towards the alter down the aisle, he skirted the pews around the edge of the nave, the heels of his shoes squeaking against the floor. He came to an oratory, there were candles burning on rows of tiny cast iron holders. Small white votive offerings. Beaton up a fresh candle and lit it. He didn\rquote t prey, just watched the flickering hand of flame that waved on the wick. He took some more and stuffed them into his pockets. There, in a small alcove of dressed stone, was a small statue of Mary, her arms apart small white hands in a gesture of supplication. Her head tilted , a sad expression on her face. Beaton touched the hem of her robe, the plaster was cold and grainy to the touch. He carried on towards the chancel. To his left he noticed a door ajar. It was set into the dark panelling and was of the same design so that when it was closed it was  almost hidden from view. He peered between the crack. He could see a bench, the type you might find in a locker room. Above, hanging from a row of pegs hung priestly robes. Black and purple vestments, some with embroidered symbols. \lquote Backstage of the theatre\rquote  Beaton thought to himself. He remembered his communion when he was just a small boy. The wafer sticking to the roof of his mouth. The uncomfortable silence, waiting for his first confession to finish. He never told about the animals he had killed.

It had been a stressful couple of weeks. The nativity play and the extra services had all added so much extra time to his schedule. If he was being honest with himself he would have admitted that he was looking forward to getting it all out of the way and returning to the quiet routine of the church. There was a blip in the attendance of his congregation this time of year but he knew he would not see any of them again until next time around, except maybe for the weddings and the funerals. His congregation was dwindling, It was tiresome to give lip service to people who didn\rquote t care. He was fed up worth initiatives to boost number, it wasn\rquote t why he had become a priest, to pursued people  to come to church. He was there to serve God. Then there was Mr Simmons, ever since his wife had passed away he had practically moved into the church. \lquote I will speak to him after }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid1986307 Christmas}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid14838232\charrsid615944  is out of the way.\rquote  The priest told himself. \lquote Every time I turn around, he seems to be standing their as if waiting my instruction. He means well but he causes more trouble than good\rquote . Mr Simmon\rquote s was part of the Parish council, he was full of great ideas to get the empty pews filled and he wasn\rquote t afraid to express the failings of Father David Forde, at meetings. He seemed to do it in such an easy underhand way whilst at the same time remaining so polite and amiable. He knew from experience that it was going to be difficult to get rid of him, he did so much around the church that it was going to look bad to shake off such an avid volunteer. \lquote I must do it, not to would be much worse. I will go mad otherwise.\rquote  Father David had started getting to the church two hours early just to beat Mr Simmons and to get some peace with God. There was no part of the church that he could escape from the man so instead he had been sneaking in early and leaving later than normal. He had even found himself wishing that it had been he that had died and not the late Mrs Simmon\rquote s. The man seemed to be some sort of a test but he hadn\rquote t worked out why he was being tested in such a way. It was too dangerous to cycle so he walked the mile to the church on foot, he would have to salt the paths and shovel the snow away so that that it was safe for the morning worshippers who would wind their way down form their houses after a l ate breakfast. \lquote Nobody, seems to invite me for lunch anymore, they don\rquote t seem to want to be reminded of the church in their houses thee days\rquote . He unlocked the heavy oak door with the oversized iron key and pushed inside. He took the steps down into the crypt and checked the boilers thermostat. It was a huge ancient piece of machinery. Patched up over the years, just waiting to break down once and for all. He could here the dripping water from the snow melt as it trickled through the grates forming puddles on the floor. It was a sad sight to see the church like this. The vaults filled with the tired nativity props, old wheelchairs, broken headstones and workman\rquote s tools. \lquote It\rquote s shameful, simply shameful. All those poor benefactors who paid good money to be buried down here, now it looks like a disused store room.  There\rquote s just isn\rquote t enough money to keep this place going, I must organise some more fund raising events in the new year. Oh, but whats the use, bake sales and home made jam isn\rquote t going to sort this mess out.\rquote  The priest picked up a bag and looked inside, it was filled with old shoes. They were all a size seven. \lquote Why are these even here? I  could write to the Archdeacon again about extra funding but I doubt it would do any good. This is not why I joined the church.\rquote  He went back upstairs to get make a cup of tea, in his office he saw an old brown woollen cardigan belonging to Mr Simmon\rquote s  hanging on the coat stand. It was something he often wore when he was working in the grounds. Father David felt a pang of resentment and fought to push it out of his mind. He had forgotten to get milk again. \lquote I hate black tea.\rquote  He made himself a black coffee instead. He was busying himself about the kettle when he heard a noise from outside in the nave. \lquote Oh no, he\rquote s early\rquote . He thought to himself. His heart sank.

I wasn\rquote t expecting you. You\rquote re rather early.\rquote  It was the voice of a man, it came from an adjoining room. Beaton hurried out the way he came, the voice called after him, asking him not to run. Beaton stopped near the statue and turned. There was a small old man. He had a pleasant face, he was balding, his greying wisps of hair combed over his scalp. \lquote I\rquote m afraid our service doesn\rquote t start till ten, but if you need to talk to somebody?\rquote  Beaton didn\rquote t reply at first he just stared down at the floor. \lquote Did you need someone to talk to? I\rquote ve just put the kettle on.\rquote  He had come here to talk to somebody but the words wouldn\rquote t come that stuck at the back of his throat. \lquote Confess, confess, confess.\rquote  The words spun around in his head. It was no use he couldn\rquote t make the words come out and the sight of the kind old man only made him feel more and more ridiculous. Beaton grabbed the statue and pulled it to the floor. It was dashed into pieces, great chunks of bright white plaster. \lquote Why, you vandal, you vandal, you should be ashamed of yourself?\rquote  The vicars face contorted with rage as he ran at Beaton with his arms in the air as if he were scaring away a flock of birds on the beach. Beaton ran out the door, the Vicars curses, trapped behind the slam of the heavy oak door. The vicars words replayed themselves in his mind. \lquote If there is anything I could do to help?\rquote  \lquote Help, It\rquote s too late for help.\rquote  Beaton thought to himself. \lquote No one will help me now, no one will forgive me. Not even God will me. Not even a bastard God, who sacrificed his own son, would forgive me now.\rquote   He retraced his steps down to the river and back up onto the rec. He was raving aloud, spitting the words out in hot breaths. \lquote I should not have come here, I should have gone straight to the mines. To think that you would try and confess to a priest, confess to a man who is crazier than you. What would his forgiveness mean to me. Him, alone in his church, day after day, lighting his candles and saying his prayers. Who is he but a crazy man.\rquote  He threw the statue over the fence  and followed after it. He was laughing now. \lquote Stupid old fool, scared to be alive. Sitting in his little church afraid of a phantom, a ghost, a ghoul in the sky.\rquote   He though about how the vicar had become so angry over a statue, a dumb old statue, he felt as if he had achieved a small victory. As if he had exposed the man for the mans real nature, his real feeling. \lquote All that old fool care about is preserving himself in that fucking tomb.\rquote  Beaton retraced his steps back up to the meadow and continued on the path that led into the quarry. \par \par \tab  It took Beaton all morning to divide the rest of the body into portions that he could easily carry. He would have to make two separate trips to completely dispose of the body parts. He had had a great deal of trouble in detaching both of the legs. After he had cut around all the flesh of the buttocks and hips he had twisted and popped the ball joints from the hip sockets. The act of dismemberment was easier to overcome than he had first feared. It became simply a reality, a fact that had to be face up to. He was more concerned by his next biggest problem, what to do wit the old lady in the garage near his home. An even bigger problem that was not going to go away. He decided that it would be best to wait at least until }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid2432261 M}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid14838232\charrsid615944 onday to dispose of the body parts. He covered them back up beneath the rocks.  The quarry was surely to be busier at the weekends and he wanted to avoid being seen as much as was possible. Once the deed was over he ate some of the food from the duffle bag and took some heavy slugs form the bottle of port. The sweet syrupy liquid warmed him some, it was a small relief. He opened up the travelling suitcase and dumped the things out. He picked through the clothes to see what he had taken. There was a green woollen cardigan with faux glass buttons. He stripped off his duffel coat and put it on underneath. There was also several pair of tights. He removed his trousers. The tights felt itchy, they snagged against the hairs on his legs. Still, anything to stay warm. He used the rest of the clothes as a kind of mattress. He flattened them out and layered them. He had to think about how to dispose of Mrs Gream. He couldn\rquote t leave her in the garage, he certainly couldn\rquote t dismember her there either. He knew it was possible to do it in the quarry but how on earth was he going to transport the body. He didn\rquote t have a car and she would be too heavy to drag. He sat sipping at the port in the waining glow of the torchlight. Then it struck him. The answer was staring him right in the face. \par \par \tab A pain, a sharp stinging pain and a struggle to take in air. She was cold, very cold. \lquote I am dead, dear God, at last I am dead. Alf, I just want to see you Alfred. Where are you?\rquote  The whole of her body was rigid, constricted. When she realised that she was still alive she wished only to die.

She tried not to gag on the knotted fabric filling her mouth. \lquote Relax and breath, just relax and breath\rquote . It was all she could tell herself, she had no choice. She waited and prayed for it too be over soon.\par \par  The temperatures had dropped so low that particles of moisture had frozen in the air.

Nobody paid him much mind but it did little to stave off his paranoia. Every face that gave him more than a glance was judging him. Murderer, killer, fiend, pervert. He thrust his chin beneath the collar of his coat. He was visibly dishevelled. He knew that. A filthy looking wretch. But what he didn\rquote t realise was that this was actually his saving grace. Nobody cared about the human train crash, the wreck. The man that people side step to avoid. He was merely an embarrassment a person that made others feel uncomfortable. The shopping mall had been the pride and joy of the town, constructed in the mid eighties, a central part of a grandiose planning and redevelopment scheme. It\rquote s design which had been an attempt to embrace the modern and cutting edge was now tired and dated. A throwback to a time when all hope for the future was in retrospect shockingly short sighted. He weaved his way to the department store. The security guard eyed him as he pushed through the heavy glass door. After getting lost for a while he found himself in the shoe department. On the far wall at the back hung rows and racks filled with luggage. He roamed the aisle, he couldn\rquote t see what he was looking for. \par \tab \lquote May I help you?\rquote \par \tab Beaton swung around, a young girl, smarty dressed in a blouse a pencil skirt was standing in front of him. \par \tab \lquote Errm Yes, I need one of these but bigger, as big as you have.\rquote \par \tab Beaton reached up and touched the travel case.\par \tab \lquote We don\rquote t really have anything much bigger, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid1986307 there\rquote s}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid14838232\charrsid615944  this one.\rquote  The girl pulled out some small steps and handed down another suitcase.

In the hardware store, Beaton bought some more batteries, rope, gas canisters and a vicious looking carpet cutting knife. It was amazing to him how you could buy such combinations of items without even raising an eyebrow. He also had a little money left over to stop at a greasy spoon and order a full english. He munched on the food and stared out the window at the the passers by all swaddled up, running from shop to shop all of them desperate to spend their money on anything. He didn\rquote t look so out of place in the cafe. Just another down and out, hiding from the cold trying to stay alive. He ate slowly, methodically, he was in no hurry at all. He couldn\rquote t make his next move until it was dark. He looked at his broken watch at adjusted it to the one on the wall, winding it till he felt the tension of the spring mechanism resist.

Turning his back to the wind he lit the cigarette beneath cupped hands. It was his first cigarette in fifteen years. They hadn\rquote t improved the taste in all that time but the thick heavy smoke felt good in his lungs. He remembered a saying he had heard. \lquote Once a smoker always a smoker, you just had to wait for the chips to be down enough.\rquote  Kaiser padded along at his side sniffing at the air. He knew where he was going even before Michael did. Maybe it was the dog who was really leading the way. Maybe it was the cigarette smoke that had reminded him of his walks with Emma. Emma had never given up smoking, it was a vice that she had chosen to keep. He never came to the quarry, why would he, it was torture enough living in the same house where he had lived with and loved his little boy.

He walked over the pallet where he had left the body. It was gone.  Beaton grabbed the blood stained sheet and knotted it around his hand, shaking and mopping it about the floor. As if somehow Mrs Gream could be shaken out like a small rodent from within. He lifted the pallet and threw it across the floor, kicking at a stack of rotten tea chests. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid1986307 That\rquote s}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid14838232\charrsid615944  when he heard the muted whimper. She was crouched in the corner. Jammed between the wall and the broke down shelving unit, huddled into herself, her hooded head resting on one shoulder.\par \tab  He felt at that moment like he was loosing his grasp. Like a boat in a storm. The tethers and ropes that bound and held his life on course were running through his hands and unravelling into finer and finer strands. Fibres too fine to catch. Once they were gone he would have no control, no direction. He enjoyed it, that was the problem. He actually enjoyed to feel that power of life over death but he had always pretended to himself that he was only half responsible. That he had had no choice, like a child who throws stones at passing cars and is surprised when he causes an accident. He had relieved himself of all the consequences that resulted from his actions. To push a person from a cliff, to drop a stone upon a head, it didn\rquote t seem to the same as choking out a persons life with your bare hands. He had killed animals before. That was how he had first felt the thrill of life over death. He started small, plucking the legs from the water boatman. Watching them sink. Then it was the frogs. Caught in fishing nets, trapped inside plastic bags. Swung against the trunks of trees or squashed beneath a bicycle wheel.He would spend hours in the garden trapping the fledgling birds in the springtime. It wasn\rquote t simply the sort of thing that nasty little boys do, it was also more than that. It thrilled him to his core. He was obsessed by it, he thought about it, planned it. Concocting new ways to kill the creatures that God had given to him to do as he wished. that was how he thought of them, each life a gift to be taken. Springtime was his season for killing. For a while he had stopped but he never forgot, it never went away. He simply learned to hide it. He fantasised, dreamed of something bigger. Something more substantial.\par \tab He had cornered a rabbit once. He had spotted at the top of a large sloping meadow. Normally he would have o chance with a rabbit. They saw him coming from a mile away. He chased it, not thinking in any way that he would catch it. The rabbit bounded along the hedgerow looking for a way to escape but it was clearly in difficulty. Trying to force itself through the dense unbroken thicket. He rushed at the animal, it doubled back trying to flee back down the slope of the field. Beaton couldn\rquote t understand what it was thinking. Then he saw it\rquote s face, it was a seething mass of lumps. Its eyes swollen shut, the creature was blind, infected with the Myxomatosis virus. He grabbed it by the hind legs, it squirmed and bucked. He ran with it held out at arms length, the blind animal squirming in his grip to get free. In the corner of the field by the railway track was an old army pill box. Abandoned after the war, it was a place that he and his friend used as a meeting place and a den. Running, he swung the Rabbit, spinning like a shot putter, dashing its brains out against the wall of the concrete bunker. He threw the carcass inside the pill box. He returned a few days later with his friend. The body had been mauled and gored by a fox. He never mentioned to his friends that it was he who had left it there. He was secretly proud but later he felt ashamed by their disgust at his handiwork. \par \tab Then one day, when Beaton was fourteen, everything changed. He had been in the quarry, he shouldn\rquote t have been there. He wasn\rquote t allowed.  Some older kids had recently climbed up onto one of the overhanging trees and hitched up a rope swing. It hung perilously in front of one of the steepest pitt, swinging out in an arc above a steep drop. Beaton had seen it and had been thinking about it and nothing else all that week. He stood at the edge holding the rope tight and looking down. His stomach felt butterflies like when he was up on the diving board at the swimming pool. There came the sound of something crashing through the undergrowth behind him. He spun round, in front of him was a god looking young boy roughly his age, maybe a little older. Next to him on a leash was a dog, it was still a puppy, not more than maybe six months old. \par \tab \lquote Hi\rquote  said the boy\par \tab \lquote Err Hi\rquote  Said Jonathan, clearly both of them had expected to have the rope swing completely to themselves.\rquote \par \tab \lquote Pretty neat, huh!\rquote  Beaton didn\rquote t reply, he didn\rquote t recognise the boy or his dog. He was not from the same school. The boy came to the edge and peered over to inspect the drop. \par \tab \lquote You\rquote d die if you fell.\rquote  continued the boy, looking down.\par \tab \lquote It\rquote s not so far.\rquote  Said Beaton, he didn\rquote t want to look afraid in front of the boy. \par \tab \lquote Go on then, I dare you, I dare you, go on bet you wouldn\rquote t.\rquote \par \tab \lquote You wouldn\rquote t do it?\rquote  The boy Gave Beaton a shove forward whilst at the same time grabbing his jacket and pulling him back immediately.\par \tab \lquote Saved your life!\rquote  The boy cried, Beaton felt the hot wet against his leg in an instant. He had pissed himself. He had wet his pants in front of this boy, he felt like he could just drop off the edge and die. The young boy was in fits of laughter. He fell back pointing at Beaton\rquote s crotch, sitting on the ground thumping the dirt with his fists. Tears of laughter rolling down his flushed red cheeks.\par \tab \lquote Haha, pissed your pants, you should have seen your face Oh my God, you pissed your pants.\rquote  Kaiser was yapping and jumping around as if he were involved in some fun game. Beaton didn\rquote t even think twice about what he was doing he was so incensed. He shoved the boy onto the floor and grabbed the puppy by its leash dragging it up into his arms.\par \tab \lquote Hey, what are you doing, don\rquote t be stupid put him down your scaring him.\rquote  \par \tab \lquote I\rquote ll drop him, I swear.

No, wait, please stop a minute.\rquote \par \tab The boy was almost crying now. Pleading on his knees in the dirt.\par \tab \lquote Let him go, let him go.

There was a loop knotted in the end that was be used as a footing to stand in when swinging. Beaton lowered the dog down over the precipice so that Kaiser was out of sight.\par \tab \lquote Don\rquote t, don\rquote t.\rquote  Beaton was smiling, he was enjoying himself now that he had the upper hand.\par \tab \lquote Put it over your head.\rquote  he brought Kaiser up onto his lap. \par \tab \lquote What?\rquote \par \tab \lquote Put the rope over your head.

He hated the boy, the sight of him standing with his puppy in his arms. His victory had left him even more bitter. Beaton, standing there in his own cold piss whilst the boy and his dog were happily reunited.\par It was the hand of the ugly spirit, the worm that turned inside his brain. One shove, one small shove was all it took to send the boy and his dog spilling over the edge of the cliff.  \par \tab \par \tab Beaton knotted a length of the waxed rope between both his fists. It was about as long as a skipping rope. He dragged Mrs Gream away from the wall, she was screaming now, choking on the wadded mass of fabric in her mouth. A high pitched stifled scream rising in intensity. Pushing her forward he swung the rope over her her, quickly wrapping it in a double loop around her neck. He shortened the slack by winding his fists into the cable so that each hand held six inches of cord either side her throat. He pulled his arms apart, crushing the windpipe with all his strength. He thought about the young boys legs kicking out over the edge of the drop. The way his hands had struggled at the rope around his throat and the eyes swollen in their sockets like hard boiled eggs. The little puppy yapping. Yapping, yapping, yapping, yapping, yapping, yapping, yapping. Beaton looked down at the limp body, his hands were bleeding. \par \par \tab It had been a struggle to fit the body of the old lady into the sports bag. It wasn\rquote t the size that was the problem it was the shape. With one end of the rope he bound her legs together, winding it around several times before knotting it. He threaded the loose end underneath her armpits around her back, beneath her already trussed arms, and out the other side. He wrapped the rope around her legs again and then several times around the back of her neck. As he pulled the rope tighter her body doubled over. He heard a crack of the vertebrae as Mrs Gream\rquote s head was pulled up to and between her knees. With the body now roped fast  tightly he was able to roll it into the bag. He zipped her inside. She was heavy to pull but he found that if he leant into the wind with all his bodyweight it wasn\rquote t to much of a struggle. It was difficult to plough through the deeper snow, the wheels weren\rquote t up to it, so he tried to keep to the salted roads and pavements. It took him more than an hour to climb the incline from the canal through the woods to the brow of the valley. The bowed black silhouette of a ragged man on the ridge line, dragging a burden through the snow. Putting his shoulder to the wheel. In the distance a dog barked. \par \par Michael could hear Kaiser, he was barking somewhere up ahead. It was hard to see the path in the dying light of the quarry floor but he had some idea of where the animal was going. It was a part of the quarry he knew all to well, a place to avoid. He whistled and called but the dog wouldn\rquote t come.\par \tab \lquote Kaiser stop fucking about.\rquote  The ground became rockier, the snow had blanketed the deep pot holes between the boulders. He clambered between the stones, the snow up to his waist.  Kaiser stood facing him from the mouth of the cave, his ears were pulled back, his tail up leaning down onto his paws. Each time he let loose a sharp bark he jumped backwards slightly. The dog let loose a few more cries before disappearing into the mine. He struggled after the dog, sliding  down through the loose scree on the gradient that descended into the chamber. The frozen rivulets of ice, slumped and waxed around the mouth of the cave, silently creeping down the rock face like tree sap. The dog was in agitated, lifting its muzzle in the air and baying and snapping at the roots of an old trees stump in the centre of the space. Mike came around behind Kaiser and grabbed his collar, attaching the leash he yanked him away from the tree stump. He smacked Kaiser on the rump, the dog whelped and crouched submissively, his belly down flat against the ground.\par \tab \lquote What the Hell\rquote s got into you. Is Emma here, is that it? Emma,......Emma, can you here me. Emma.\rquote  The hollow sound of his voice ricocheted around his head. It was too dark, he couldn\rquote t see a thing. Mike rocked on his heels then fell back into a sitting position. He hugged Kaiser around the neck. He began to weep. He felt the warm tracks running down over his cheeks. They gatherer in his beard. Kaiser warm tongue licked his face.\par \tab \lquote Where has she gone boy.

She left a lamp on for company. She went upstairs and looked in on Leo and Greg. One of Leo\rquote s arms was flung around his blue octopus. One leg thrust out over the edge of the bed from beneath the duvet. Greg was on his side facing the wall, some Star Wars figures lying at his back.

Jill sat alone at the table and sipped at her tea.\par \tab \lquote That girl. she\rquote s so flighty. Blows hot and cold all the time.\rquote  \par \par \tab Hollis drove slowly, visibility was poor in the swirling white clouds of snow As if that wasn\rquote t enough, the black ice on the road made driving condition treacherous. Great humped piles of grey freezing slush lined both sides of the empty streets. She had to keep the windscreen wipers going against the great falling flakes that drifted to earth in unbounded multitudes. On the radio they were urging people to avoid all unnecessary travel. It was the heaviest snowfall since records began and there was little sign that it was going to stop anytime soon. Hollis parked the car at a corner opposite a row of small shops. She didn\rquote t want to risk being seen, she was in enough trouble as it was without adding to her mounting problems. Opening the glove compartment, she took out a torch and put it into her coat pocket. She reached behind the back seat where she found, lying beneath a pile of road maps, an extendable wheel brace. She took that too. Getting out the car she slipped the wheel brace into her belt beneath her coat and set off towards the garages. Hollis kept cover below the line of the ram shackled fences, staying within the confines of the shadows cast from the light of the rear terrace windows. She noticed that the snow here had been kicked up and disturbed somewhat by the police earlier that day. \lquote What are you doing Hollis. This is a sure fire way to get yourself kicked of the force for good.\rquote   There was a gap of about two feet or so between the ground and the raised lip of the garage door. She took the wheel brace from her belt loop and  extended the arm. She switched on the torch, keeping the beam low against the ground so as to cast less light. She hooked the angled end of the wheel brace beneath the lip of the door and lifted it slowly whilst shining the beam into the darkness. The light hugged the line of the walls and crept across the boxes and bounced shadows over the broke down shelves that lay scattered about. She had to duck low to creep inside and once over the threshold she pulled the door to behind her as far to the floor as the rusting springs would allow. \lquote I know that you\rquote ve been here Beaton, I know it.\rquote  She shone the beam on the glistening fragments of glass she had seen before. It looked as if some of the crates and the shelf had been moved. Lying across a wooden pallet was a soiled bed sheet, it had a large blood stain roughly in it\rquote s centre. On top of it was a short length of blue nylon rope. She had seen something similar recently but she couldn\rquote t remember quite where. \lquote Oh Christ\rquote . Hollis used the end of the tyre brace to lift one corner of the bedding. Underneath was an empty discarded gas canister, the kind use for a camping stove. Hollis crouched and tapped it with the wrench. \lquote You fucker, you little fucker, you\rquote ve been up there all this time.\rquote  Shouldering open the broken door, Hollis backed out into the alleyway. At the same time she saw a fox jump from a neighbouring fence and land softly in the snow, no more than a few metres away. They had startled each other, they had accidentally stumbled into each others lives. The animal stared into Hollis\rquote s eyes, a cold mysterious look that left Hollis rooted to the spot. Sizing her up and not being phased the fox padded on a few more metres and turning to catch another look it disappeared into a bush glazed with heavy snow. If a foxes face could crack a smile then this one had been grinning. The hunt had begun.\par \tab Beaton could see the two dark figures moving against the white of the snow. He was waiting at the top of the cliff by the old rope swing. The cave was attracting far too much attention. He knew that he would not be safe there for much longer. All he had to do was get rid of the old lady. Without a body there was no crime. He would go away somewhere. Lay low and then return after back after some time. He would be able to deal with their questions then. He would have thought of something to explain for why he had disappeared. Beaton waited near the rope swing for some time. Sitting hunched forward on the suitcase watching the flakes of snow swirl and tumble into the pitt. He was exhausted, he couldn\rquote t face lugging the suitcase all the way down the slope and across the approach to the cave. He wheeled the suitcase to the edge of the cliff. The very same spot he had last seen Jonathan. He stood the bag on end with the wheels facing towards himself and shoved down the retractable handle so it was no longer sticking up. With one push he sent the bag sliding from the precipice and down through the air it fell. Turning over once and landing with a muted \lquote wump\rquote  into a patch of snow covered boulders. The bag was a little damaged. There was a large crack in the rigid base of  which help to give it is shape. One of the wheels was slightly more than wonky too. He daren\rquote t think about the damage it might have done to the little old lady who was parcelled up inside. It was only after Beaton had grappled with the bag for a few minutes that he realised what a mistake he had made. There was little chance that he was going to get the bag into the tunnels. There was no clear path, the floor was littered with huge slabs of icy stone and rock lying beneath the snow. Even when he had managed to get into the cave he was never going to move the body all the way to the camp. There were too many people sniffing around now too, he couldn\rquote t abandon the bag where to could be found. He would need a place to keep the body out of sight, just until he was strong enough to move it again.\par \tab That night Michael couldn\rquote t sleep, he tried to read but it didn\rquote t help. His wife was around him everywhere. The reading glasses on the nightstand, the dressing gown on the door. Her shoes by the cupboard. All screaming at him in disgust at his constant state of inertia.  He felt helpless, he needed to be doing something, anything. \lquote I can\rquote t just lie here. I can\rquote t just go to bed and wait for someone to find Emma. It\rquote  me, I should be the one. I should be the one spending every waking hour looking for her. Not waiting for the police to come and for it to all be too late.\rquote  He threw back the covers and pulled his jeans and shirt on over his pyjamas. From the back of the wardrobe he took out his fathers shotgun. It was an old BSA 12 bore boxlock. The smell of gun oil from inside its canvas bag released with it a thousand memories. The high swish of a stick beating at the tangled undergrowth. The beat and flurry of the pheasants wings as they rose into the air. The long misty mornings gathered int the fields the dogs howling and baying. The jolt and kick of the butt against his shoulder. It seemed like another life time. He reached up on top of the wardrobe and took down a box of red shells, he slid two into each of the breech ends. The shotgun rested broken in two halves over the crook of his elbow. It was dark downstairs but he could see Kaisers eyes shining, filled with the light from the upstairs landing. \lquote C\rquote mon boy. Get your coat on and show me what you were looking at up there in the quarry.\rquote  Kaiser snorted through his nose as if he resented being woken, he sniffed at the cold steel barrel. Michael, wrapped in his waxed jacket and scarf took a flashlight and a roll of gaffer tape from a tool box beneath the stairs He stuffed the tape into one of his deep poaching pockets. With leash in hand, man and dog followed the pale yellow beam of light up the hill back towards the quarry.\tab \par \tab Beaton awoke in his bed and tried to lift open his eyes The lids remained stuck so he peeled them open with his fingers. They were glued together with a dried crust. He could hear the wind whipping down the chimney and beneath the eaves. He was alone, he knew that he was alone in the old house. The sheets were knotted about his legs as though he had been tossing and turning in his sleep. He could feel the cool sweat on his skin, he was feverish. It was his childhood home, a place he had not stepped foot in for thirty years or more. He knew every inch of it and he could survey every corner with his mind if he pushed himself and his memories to do so. Moving from room to room, opening and closing doors. It was a small old stone cottage with a pitched roof set by the side of a busy road. The house had originally been part of a larger granary but over time it had been converted into two houses. The stones had been robbed from a cathedral after the dissolution of the great monasteries. It was true, some of the stone bore the marks of masons and there was even an elaborate piece of a corbel window set into a section of the upstairs wall. The road had been widened to make way for heavier traffic that fed a new major bypass to a larger town. The loose pains rattled in the windows as the lorries rumbled passed. It was a cold place, it had no radiators or a boiler and in the winter, the inside of the windows would be covered with a sheet of ice. There was a large open fireplace that when unlit, drew all the remaining heat from out of the house. The plaster was yellowed by damp and had crumbled into dusty piles on the stairs and along the skirting boards. The wooden beams were sodden and spongy at the ends. The bathtub was always filled with stranded woodlice. The tiles had slid from the roof and lay smashed about in the undergrowth. He stood up and went to the window, he looked down at the lamplight shining on the street. The sloping road that led form the pub to the churchyard. The tennis courts and the playing fields. The black hills against the deepening cobalt sky. But it wasn\rquote t real, he knew that it was just like a photograph, a still. No one would walk by because everyone from that time had gone. If he reached out he could tear it all down with his bare hands. The house felt alive, baring down on him, an intense focus drawn from every fibre of the building surged around Beaton seated on the bed. He felt and heard the beating from within the walls, the house was alive. He went back to his bed. The bed began to writhe beneath him as if something were trapped within it. There came the wailing of a child, the muffled cries of a baby trapped inside. He stripped the bed in a hurry, flinging the sheets into a heap upon the bare floorboards. Raking and clawing at the exposed fabric of the mattress. Unravelling and pulling at the stuffing of the bed removing coiled springs and dry and straw tufts yellowing packed cotton. Lurking in the very heart of the bed was a small wooden box, it was a perfect cube carved from a dark teak wood. It\rquote s surface was worn smooth with age. One face of the cube was set with a single hole in the centre and recessed within was an eye, clouded and misty with a grey green glaze. It had no eyelid with which to blink and it rolled and darted from this way to that. The wailing climbed and climbed to an ever greater pitch until the noise had filled his head completely. He threw the box into the corner it bounced and rolled along like a dice, clattering across the floor boards. On the blank upward facing side of the cube there appeared an orifice. It was toothless and from between it\rquote s smooth gums there was the flick of a tiny reddish brown tongue inside, glistening, like a thin slice of raw liver. He stuffed his fingers into his hears but he couldn\rquote t stop the howling wails. from rattling through his fevered brain. The wailing turned to laughing and before he knew what he was doing he was rolling on the floor pounding the boards with his fists. He gathered up the box into his lap and crouching in the corner of the room he screamed and laughed. There were two small holes either side of the mouth. He pushed his fingers into its ears and stared into its wild eye and laughed in it\rquote s face. Giggling and shaking like some mad fiend. Shuddering in wild spasms as if every synapse were suddenly overloaded with great jolts of electricity. \par \par He awoke on the freezing cold slab, the fur coat wrapped across his shoulders. His body quaked with the cold that seemed to have crept into every muscle every fibre of his body. His jaw juddered uncontrollably. The pale blue halo from the camping stove winked in the darkness like a sprite. \lquote This place is driving me mad, I\rquote ll lose my mind if I stay here. What was that. There,.... a noise. I hear it.\rquote  There came from somewhere the sound of a dog. It was barking within the surrounding gloom. He gripped the handle of the carpet knife in his pocket. \par \par Hollis took the main A road that left the Town and headed towards London. The road ran right through the village.

She turned right at the traffic lights by the old church and took the small road that dipped down towards the river and rose again past the Quarryman\rquote s arms. The road had become a river of black ice that wound up along the side of the woods. It was not going to be possible to drive to the top of the Quarry so Hollis parked the car by the side of the pub. She peered through the window, a light fell across the bar through an open doorway. Apart from this there was no other signs of life except the scent of burning coal floating in the cold sterile air. Somewhere, someone was sitting before the glow of a warm hearth. The slow steady crunch and creak of the compacted snow beneath her feet, she trudged along the roadside being careful not to fall into the snow filled ditch. Her legs sinking into the white powder right up to her knees. Clotted lumps of gathering white flakes attached themselves to her clothing. She looked at the signal bar on her phone, it slowly began to creep up as she ascended the hill.\par The phone began to ring, it went to voicemail. \lquote Steve, Steve, It\rquote s Hollis. I\rquote m up at the Quarry. I can\rquote t explain everything over the phone but I know where he is, I know where he\rquote s hiding. If you get this message call me back.\rquote  She hung up and set the phone\rquote s ring tone to vibrate and returned it to her coat pocket. The snow was shallower under the tree cover. It was easy to see the clear tracks that had been made recently through the snow. She turned out the torch, and guided her way by the deep black impressions stamped along the the white snowy path like a giant length of ticker tape.\par \par As soon as Kaiser was freed from his leash he bolted into the darkness of the chamber. \lquote Fuck sake Kaiser!\rquote  Michael threw the torch down the slope ahead of himself and with one arm holding the shotgun and the other outstretched beneath him he carefully descended into the mine. He snapped shut the breech of the gun and placed it on the floor next to the torch. He reeled off a long strip of gaffer tape and bit it in two and bound the torch onto the end of the shotgun barrel.  \lquote Kaiser!!!, come here now!\rquote  The dog appeared from one of the tributary tunnels and circled the large charred root at the centre of the chamber his tail wagging. Coils and puffs of hot steam rolled from the panting mouth of the dog. With the shotgun at his hip, Michael scanned the ground. Kaiser began to bark, he was stamping his front paws in the\par dust by the side of the tree stump, the exact same spot he had been getting excited over yesterday. \lquote What is it Kaiser, Aye?\rquote  Michael squatted down leaning on the stock of the gun, the torchlight shining upwards bouncing from the low rock ceiling above. \lquote Whats got into you, eh?\rquote  Michael scratched Kaiser behind his ears and ran his hand along the length of his spine and patted his rump. Kaiser began to whine and paw at the twisted mass of roots of the tree stump. \lquote Git, you great lummox, what you got there?\rquote  Michael, resting on one knee, aimed the barrel of the shotgun at the stump. There was something out of place, something poking out from between the dry woody stems. He took hold of it an pulled it out. \lquote Emma.\rquote  He stood up and pressed the  button on the handle, popping the umbrella open. \lquote Emma, why would you of come down here of all places.\rquote  He laid the open umbrella on the top of the tree stump. Kaiser bolted again, running into the far left tunnel, leaping over boulder he melted into the darkness and was lost form sight. \lquote Ok Kaiser, I\rquote ll listen to you this time, you lead the way then.\rquote  \par \par \tab The first thing that Beaton heard was the scrabble and scratch of loose rocks and the sound of claws clicking over the hard stones. He was crouching in a corner of the niche above the slab when kaiser found him. In a flash he felt the jaws bite into his coat, just above the right shoulder, the dog snarling and jarring his head from side to side as if to shake Beaton out from his hiding place. The sound of fabric tearing open at the seams. Beaton swung the blade up in his right hand and kicked out with one leg. There was a loud wailing whimper and the dog let go. Beaton tried to stand up but before he had the chance to extend his legs Kaiser was up and on him again. The animals jaws nosing into the soft flesh of his throat, his muzzle burrowing into the gore. Flailing beneath the beast, Beaton slashed and cut indiscriminately with the blade whilst trying to hold the animal back with his free hand. He felt the hot spurt of liquid onto his face  and the bloated sag of something soft slide into his lap. His fingers still holding the coarse hair, he felt the animal go limp and the jaws about his throat relax and slacken. He scrambled backwards from underneath the dog pulling himself up the wall. His jeans were soaked through to the skin and the air was rank with the smell of shit and blood. He heard a voice calling in the tunnel, \lquote Kaiser, kaiser, come ere boy. Come ere boy.\rquote  \par \tab He could feel the puncture wounds in his neck swelling, puffing around the edges. He tried to stem the flow of the bleeding with his hand and the cuff of his coat. It felt as if red hot coals were burning inside of his throat. He knew that he was bleeding pretty badly, he could feel the warm steady stream escaping between his fingers and soaking into his vest beneath his sweater. He pressed his head towards his chest to try and close the wound. The carpet knife felt sticky with blood in the grip of his hand. Beaton stumbled over the body and moved deeper into the cave concealing him behind a boulder not far from the niche.\par \tab It was the smell that hit Michael first. He hadn\rquote t even had a chance to cast the torch around the cave before the rank stench pushed him back and made him gag. It was a scene of utter savagery, Kaiser on his side with his intestines lying in a steaming pile about his hind legs. The bowel had been ruptured, spilling the dogs half digested food onto the ground . The dog carved up on the stone slab like a sacrificial alter. Michael vomited into his mouth and spat onto the floor, he covered his face with his arm. Kaiser was lying on an old fur coat. A dark pool of fresh blood dripped down the rock clotting into a deep red stalactite form the lip of the rock. A slight trace of steam clung to the surface of the cold red rock and was dispersed into the ether. The shining black pearl of the unblinking eye staring, dead cold, empty. \lquote Who the fuck\rquote s there? Come out, come out here you piece of shit!!!\rquote  The tunnel was strewn with pieces of clothing and a few items of luggage. It looked as if someone had been living down here, living amongst the cold and the rocks. There was a camping stove, surrounded by some discarded blue gas canisters and old food tins, balls of tissue smeared with dried faeces. Michael edged towards Kaisers body and placed his had upon his neck, he was still warm to the touch, the last traces of life fading beneath his hand. He rested the barrel on the edge of the stone slab and crouching down he tried to cover Kaisers ruptured belly beneath an old fur coat. The sight of the dogs was more than he could bear.\par \par The blade entered Michael\rquote s leg behind his right knee, slicing his calf in a neat line towards the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid2432261 A}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid14838232\charrsid615944 chilles heel. A thin jet of blood burst forth from the deep gash, dropping Michaels body to the floor like a sack full of spanners. He clutched at the gaping wound with his left hand. He tried to rise up using his shotgun as a crutch. Beaton moved quickly, he thrust the blade into the mans back just below the shoulder blade and pulled the knife following the line of the ribs, inwards towards the spine. It all happened in a matter of seconds, Beaton lunging, low from behind the rock cutting into the leg. Then seeing the shotgun he had panicked. Slicing the man across his back as he fled. Michael felt as if a red hot whip had gashed him across the back. He was lucky, it was only a surface wound. The thick wax coat had stopped the blade from sinking as deep as it could truly go. The blood, greasy and slick on Beaton\rquote s hands, he dropped the knife as he ran.  Beaton dashed through the tunnels, tripping several times and landing on his belly in the darkness. Any semblance of a plan was gone, it was merely a case of self preservation. \lquote Must get away, just get away, far away from here.\rquote  He saw the dim light of the chamber as he rounded a corner. There was an umbrella standing open upside down, balanced on the old stump of the tree. \lquote It must belong to that man.\rquote  Beaton thought to himself. He crouched before it and began to gather in the length of garden twine that led to his hiding place. \lquote I should never have left this here, what an idiot, you fool, you stupid fool. \rquote  He could feel the snag and the tug of the rusted chisel as it dragged like an anchor through the labyrinth of tunnels. That was where Hollis found Beaton when she descended into the low grey chamber. She saw the black silhouette of an umbrella, resting upside down at an angle on top of the gnarled dead stump of a tree. She hadn\rquote t seen Beaton yet who was kneeling down behind the tree but she could hear the click and clack of the chisel as it bounced over the surface of the tunnel making its way towards her in the dark. She took out the wheel brace and stepped lightly towards the umbrella. Something small slid across the dirt floor from one of the tunnels towards her like a snake, it was long and flat. It moved quickly.  Beaton, who had all this while been equally oblivious to Hollis\rquote s presence stood up and hearing a gasp behind him turned to see a woman standing before him. A few feet apart separated only by the upturned umbrella resting on the tree stump. \par \par \lquote Beaton, Beaton Ernest?\rquote \par \tab It had been the first tim anyone had addressed him in days, the words rolled around in his head.

There\rquote s always a choice, in everything.\rquote  Hollis had moved back to the foot of the incline at the mouth of the cave. Beaton was clear of the stump. There was no more than three metres between them. She stared into the young mans eyes. A stare, more distant and remote than the fox she had met in the alleyway. She could see that he had made his choices. Maybe he was right. Maybe he didn\rquote t have a choice in the matter anymore. \par \tab It would be difficult to say in the brief moment between standing and running who, had made the first move.  By the time Hollis had made it to the top of the slope Beaton was on her tugging at her feet as she struggled to get free. She turned to face him as Beaton buried the blunt rusted handle spike into Hollis\rquote s thigh, deep down in to the muscle till he reached the bone. She wailed in pain and set about beating Beaton about the head with the wheel brace. Short sharp blows about his head and shoulders that forced Beaton to ball into submission with his arms above him. Cowering on the floor to escape the barrage of blows. When he looked up she was gone, he followed after her climbing out of the mirk into the rich swathes of white snow. The cold gripped him around the throat and numbed the pain.  He watched her disappear across the white boulder field and out onto the trackway, limping like a lame dog. \par \tab Hollis grabbed a handful of snow and crushed it against her thigh. The blood soaking into the compacted ice. She dragged the leg like a burden, through the woods and down the hill towards the car. \lquote Just get to the car, just get to the car and drive. Oh why did you come here.\rquote  She was panting hard the clumps of snow filling her eyes and mouth. She struggled forwards, Beaton close behind her, stumbling down the hill like a ragged corpse. The car was open, she climbed inside the passenger seat and one by one, locked each of the doors from the inside. She turned the key in the ignition and the engine rumbled into life, great clouds of hot exhaust drifted past the headlights in the freezing air. She made a U turn, bringing the car around to face the road down into the village and then stopped. Instead of trying to  get in the car Beaton loped on passed, he lumbered on and up over a style into the adjoining field. \lquote He\rquote s the one running away, not me.\rquote  She looked up the hill towards the Quarry. She saw why Beaton was running. It was Michael, limping down the hill leaning on the shot gun.\par \tab His boot had filled with warm sticky blood, his sock was wet and spongy. He had used his scarf as bandage to staunch the bleeding as best as he could. He could no longer stand up straight for the wound across his back. He felt light headed, drowsy, as if he might suddenly slip into sleep. If it were not for the bitter wind that whipped the snow into icy needles against his face, he might have succumbed to the feeling. The cold was helpful in making him forget the pain that wracked his body. He kept sight of the figure in the road ahead. The man became framed in the yellow beam of a cars headlights near his pub and disappeared again form view. Michael stumbled against the bonnet of the car and looked in the windscreen at the person within. It was a young woman, she looked frightened, he vaguely recognised her from somewhere but his mind was confused. He picked up the shotgun with one hand and levelled it with her head. The halo of light blinded her eyes and she covered her face with her arms and slid down in her chair. Then the bright light was suddenly gone and when Hollis lowered her arm, so too had Michael. A single bloody handprint branded onto the bonnet of her car. She jumped from her car and laboured over the style that led into the adjoining field. Through the grey haze she could see the torchlight limping along, moving in the wake of a grey figure in the distance.\par \par Beaton was scanning the edge of the field for a break in the hedgerow. All he could see was the speckled grey line of the trees and the bushes sandwiched between the white of the ground and the sky. He ploughed through the drifts of deep snow, carving a deep furrow into the pristine landscape. It was difficult to see through the swirling squall that whipped about his head. It piled up on his shoulder and filled his mouth and his eyes. He walked along with the hedgerow to his left following the slop of the meadow past the railway bridge downhill towards the main road that bisected the valley through the middle. He could no longer see anymore and he was so tired. He shuffled barely lifting his legs, the snow piling up around his hips. He no longer saw the point in running. He remembered the diseased rabbit he had caught when he was a boy. Just like him, it had no choice in how things were going to be, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid1986307 that\rquote s}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid14838232\charrsid615944  just how things were. He stopped walking, and fell to his knees. The sound of gun shot reached him a few seconds later. The buckshot peppering his back and tearing a large hole in his shoulder spinning him around. He sank softly into the snow, the frozen ground reaching up and holding him in its arms. He rolled onto his back and looked up into Michaels face. The walls of white around his head like the sides of a coffin. The two round empty eye sockets of the shotgun hovering in front of his face. This was it, he closed his eyes and accepted his fate. There was a sharp mechanical click before he slipped beneath a dark veil.  \par \par \tab The dry cracking report of the gunshot drifted across the valley and was eventually drowned out by the dense falling snow. Hollis moved as fast as she could, following the curving tracks that the two men had already carved out. It was Michael who she discovered first. Lying on his left side clutching the gun to his chest, the beam of the torch shining up into his face, illuminating it like a ghastly death mask.  She picked it up and threw it away from him, it disappeared, swallowed up into the ground. The back of his trousers on his right leg was ragged and ripped apart, the fabric stained dark brown. She took off her scarf and wrapped it around the wound and packed it with snow. She took out her phone but was unable to get a clear signal. Hollis could tell that Michael was alive, but barely. Weak puffs of steam issuing from his shallow breath. \lquote Just hold on Mike, your gonna be fine, you here me, you're going to be OK.\rquote  Hollis found Beaton less than thirty yards ahead. Lying peacefully on his back with his arms flung out. As if he had been playing at making snow angels. There was a peppering of red spray about the ground, Beaton\rquote s right shoulder seemed to have taken the brunt of the shot but she could see that a few of the pellets had caught his neck and chest which was bruised and swollen. She checked his wrist, he was still alive, it was a miracle. The familiar sound of sirens, off in the distance. Hollis saw the blue flashing lights climbing the hillside on the road behind the hedgerow. She made her way back up the meadow towards the Quarryman\rquote s arms where the ambulance and the police van were pulling in.\par \tab Hollis was waving her arms and hollering as loud as she could, she felt breathless in the cold air. The adrenaline was wearing off and she was starting to feel tired. She saw Steve, she had never been so glad to see him. He climbed over the fence and ran towards her.

He had spent a long time in the hospital. When Hollis had visited him he had tried to seem positive but it was clear that his recovery was not going to be so simple. He had lost everything. His biggest regret was that the gun had jammed. How could there be any room for forgiveness for what that man had done? Michael said that he would move away from the town for good, he had family in Bristol who could put him up until arrangements could be made to sell the business. It seemed to Michael that somehow he had been marked in some way, a cursed man. Nothing but misfortune seemed to befall him.

People seemed to show a morbid curiosity in the infamous mines. Rilksham council decided after much pressure from the parish that it was far too dangerous a place to leave open to the public and so it was decided that the entrance be barred. The entrance was sealed off with a large metal gate that spanned the full width of the cave. Every now and then a small bouquet of flowers can still be found wilting between the metal bars. \par \tab It would not be until nine years later that the body of Emma Powell was finally discovered. When three young caver\rquote s who had been exploring the mines came across a grim discovery. They had found themselves in the vast open chamber that was known to be the Abbey. Deep beneath the hillside, it was bathed in the light that fell through a hole in the vaulted roof above. Below this hole was a well that over time had been filled with the rubble and litter that had washed down. They decided to clear the well and restore and remove the litter. In an old rotten rubble sack were a collection of bones that appeared far too human to ignore. When forensic teams were finally called in they discovered the dismembered body of a woman. The mystery of where Emma Powell\rquote s body had ben disposed had finally been solved, adding another sad chapter to Michaels life. Strangely enough, near the body of they woman they discovered the bones of a dog. Maybe a pet that had wandered off and had fallen through the grate above. \par }\pard \ltrpar\qj \li0\ri0\sl-320\slmult0\nowidctlpar\tx0\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0\pararsid16453515 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid14838232\charrsid615944 \par }\pard \ltrpar\qj \li0\ri0\sl-320\slmult0\nowidctlpar\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\tx19242\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0\pararsid16453515 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid14838232\charrsid615944 The landscape flashed by the train window. The barren trees, like witches broomsticks thrust into the ground, clinging to the horizon. The pale brown grasses, in hazy clusters, between the stubble of the corn fields. A thin band of pale blue sky above the tree tops, weighed down beneath the heavy leaden sky. The snaking pattern of the drifting snows over the brown mottled farm lands. Cottages, outbuildings, jobs and homes and lives all whisking by. The zip and dip of the wires along the pylons, undulating, on and on. It hurt her leg to sit down for any length of time, the pain in her thigh had now receded into a constant dull ache, the painkillers helped somewhat. It was the first family holiday they had had in so long that Hollis couldn\rquote t quite remember. Leo was sleeping his forehead resting on the cold glass of the window, his head rocking with the motion of the train. Hollis could see Greg\rquote s eyes flitting from left to right as he took in the passing scenery. \par \tab \par \tab \lquote Is there snakes where were going mum?\rquote \par \tab \lquote I hope so\rquote \par \tab \lquote Are they dangerous\rquote ?\par \tab \lquote Probably, yes?\rquote  Greg turned and looked at her.\par \tab \lquote Why do you hope that there\rquote s dangerous snakes?\rquote \par \tab \lquote I don\rquote t know Greg, I guess because it would be less exciting if they weren\rquote t so dangerous.\rquote \par \tab \lquote But what if I got bitten, we could die.\rquote  Hollis motioned Greg towards her.\par \tab \lquote Come here you.\rquote  Greg jumped from the chair opposite and rest his head on her shoulder, Hollis ruffled his hair.\par \tab \lquote What you so scared of young boy o?

She felt a twinge of pain shoot up her thigh into her hip. The doctor had warned her against travelling with such a wound. Especially in a country as humid as Thailand. Hollis didn\rquote t care, you only lived once so why not make the most of it. The boys had never been abroad, had never stepped on a plane. She could sense their nervousness. The last holiday that they had spent together was three years ago in Devon, it had rained non stop and the tents had leaked. As for work, well, something would turn up. Hollis didn\rquote t imagine that she would be getting a choice in the matter, she would not be returning to the force. She certainly wasn\rquote t going to be getting any medals for her actions. The press had painted her role in the incident in a favourable light but her have a go hero attitude had lost her the job. Michael had thanked her for saving him but sometimes she got the feeling when he looked at her that he wished she had left him to die. \lquote Who could blame him?\rquote  she thought to herself. Maybe she should have taken the gun and tried again. But Beaton was alive, he had been assessed and diagnosed and closeted away. He was destined to live out his days in a cell or at least until he was too old and frail to be of any harm to anyone but himself. It was not meant to have happened this way. It didn\rquote t feel like justice, it was not the type of justice that you hope for. \par \par \tab Beaton Arnold Earnest began keeping a diary of his dreams and every morning when he rose before breakfast he would write down his thoughts before they had a chance to fade in clarity. It was rare that he did not dream at all although often he could only catch a passing image or thought. Sometimes his dreams were difficult to decipher or would not translate themselves into words. Coming to him as feelings rather than images. He once dreamt that he had written a poem, of which he could clearly see each word, burning on the page in front of him as plain as day. When he awoke in the morning he couldn\rquote t remember a single word or line.\par \par From the diary of Beaton Arnold Earnest. \par \par \tab From a low barred window I could see down into the courtyard below. A grey, space surrounded on all sides by severe }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid2432261 Victorian}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid14838232\charrsid615944  redbrick buildings. Buildings that carried with them a sombre sense of industry and oppression. The courtyard was steeped in shadow, save for the thin golden slice of the evenings dying light which passed briefly there once every day. I couldn\rquote t remember why I had been locked away inside this high tower, nor for how long I had passed in that place. I had given up carving the days into the crumbling lime plaster a long time ago.  Every evening a young girl would come and sweep the leaves that blew over the rooftops and settled in piles on the mosaics floor that had been laid by prisoners, long since forgotten. The girl had long chestnut curls, tied back beneath a faded red bandanna, and across her shoulder she wore an old green woollen shall. She was pale and thin, her delicate arms moving the broom across the ground in a slow steady methodical motion. She would collect the leaves into a pile and carry them away in a large wicker basket which she took upon her back with thin leather straps. It was my only pleasure, to watch her working beneath my window. I had long since given up calling out to her, she pretended not to hear him. There came a time when I fell ill with a fever, I was taken into the infirmary, where I stole from the good doctor a scrap of paper and a pencil nub which I concealed within my shoe. I composed a most beautiful note, of which I had spent several days composing. It told of how beautiful she was, how I dreamed of escaping and carrying her away with me to a better place far, far away. The note tumbled down from between my barred window and landed on the floor like so many other leaves. I watched as the girl swept it away into the basket, giving no hint or sign that she had seen it at all. I felt my heart sink. The very next evening I waited as usual at his post. She did not appear. Nor did I see her the next day, or the day after that. I was certain that somebody had discovered the note and had punished the poor girl. My selfish act had hurt the only thing left in my life that had brought me any joy. A great many days must have past by and I had long since given up looking down from my window. The leaves had begun to pile into great drifts across the cold hard ground. Now the coming of the evenings golden light only served to cause me pain where I once found joy, so I would steal away from the window and choose instead to sleep. One evening as I lay half sleeping, I heard the dry twigs of a broom scratching at the ground, far below my cell. I was scared to look, in case I should find instead, another had taken her place. After some time I crept to the window and on seeing the same chestnut curls and the pale delicate skin I wept for joy. Then came a day when I was called to meet with the warden. He was a severe looking man with a wry smile in a stiff grey suit. The warden asked me if I felt sorry for the crimes that I had committed and if I made time to pray for Gods forgiveness. I felt unsure what my crimes have been but I must have assured the warden that I was sorry as he seemed pleased with my answer. I know I must of lied for I care nothing of God\rquote s forgiveness. Before returning to my cell I asked the Warden if he might permit  me a privilege in light of my good behaviour. \lquote There is a space in the corner of the yard below my window which unlike the rest of the courtyard has not been filled with a mosaic. It would be my humble wish to create a mosaic as a humble gesture of gratitude for my rehabilitation.\rquote  The wardens suspicious eye rested on the me. I could see the wardens thoughts playing across his mind. \lquote He has proven himself to be a well behaved prisoner and he seems an honest enough fellow.\rquote   After some moments thought he assured me as an honourable man that if I was sincere in my intentions then he would do his best to make it so. The warden seemed to me a vain man and fond of my flattery and along came the day when I was escorted in chains to a workshop. I was watched by a guard as I worked at my bench, chipping away at the tiny squares of stone, day after day returning in the evening in time to hear the sound of the girl sweeping in the courtyard below.  It took me a long time to complete and I saw the season come and go. My hands were calloused and worn from my tireless work. The dust that I breathed when grinding down the stones had clogged my lungs and laboured my breath. When Autumn came I was struck down with the pleurisy and against the doctors advice I continued to work in the cold damp air of the workshop. I was so near to finishing that I refused to stop. I saw myself die. It was the end of winter, my ashes were scattered in the cemetery grounds at the base of a bare brick wall. Nobody cried, nobody came, no cross to mark the spot. The warden personally oversaw the laying down of the mosaic in the corner of the courtyard. It was a most astonishing and detailed piece of work far greater than anything my hand do could achieve. Winged cherubs, aloft on swirling white clouds above rolling verdant pastures. Deer drinking from crystal clear waters that flowed through tumbling ravines into great wide lakes that reflected the sky. In the centre of this idyllic scene standing on the banks of the lake stood Adam with Eve at his side in Gods great garden. Cascading across her lily-white shoulders, great curls of chestnut hair. The warden was very proud of the work and would show it off on the rare occasions that visitors would come to observe the prison. He would tell the story of the murderer who, with Gods will and the help of the wardens strict rules, had found peace and forgiveness within the prisons walls. On such occasions he would ask the girl to clean and scrub the tiles until they were spotless. The girl, bent over the two figures set in stone, imagining that she was far away with a man she had never met. She would trace the figures with her fingers and wonder who or what could have inspired such a work of beauty. The dream had an almost perfect narrative that I find unusual. Normally my dreams move seamlessly between places and people that appear to have no apparent connection or meaning. Maybe now that I have time to sleep and think for days on end I will have more of these types of dream. Dreams that are linear and clear with a beginning a middle and an end. I have thought long and hard about what it must mean and I have come to the conclusion that It need not have any meaning at all. Only that it is a sad tale. I have omitted a scene where in my cell there appeared a }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid2432261 Victorian}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid14838232\charrsid615944  pram. In the pram was a baby and a plastic bag. The bag was wrapped around the decomposing head of a spotted }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid2432261 D}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid14838232\charrsid615944 almatian dog. The rest of the animal was missing. I felt that the dream was better, more complete without this minor detail. It is strange, I once was frightened by my dreams and would sooner have slept a night devoid of anything that my mind might concoct. Now I see them as something of a comfort and I feel sad when I wake with barely a single image or a feeling.  \par \par \tab When asked to describe Beaton, the guards would say that he was a model inmate. He appeared to go about his daily life as would an automaton. Happily performing the same daily tasks over and over again. It was his willingness to accept his situation that meant he must surely be happy there. Why wouldn't he be, he lived comfortably and had good health, a library full of books to read, time enough to think, He never wanted for anything. So the days rolled in and out like the waves on a shore and the weeks, like the tides, rose and fell away from the calendar without anything truly interesting happening. But at night his world came alive and his dreams, as real as anything that could be touched and held. The images blew away the prison walls and pulled him deep beneath the earth.  Lying on his cot he would imagined that he was still in that pitch black tunnel like a corpse in an ossuary lying in its niche. His bones in tidy rows. So again he began to think of all the things he had done and he felt something peaceful growing inside and understood that everything happened for a reason. It was during these moments that he felt like he had at last found God, for why would God abandon such a man as him. It was not he who guided the dagger. He was only the hand that held it. Had not Abraham shown his devotion in equal measures. He felt a sense of peace inside and he heard again the sound of angels weeping but it was only the sound of one of the new inmates crying himself to sleep. He touched the hot tears that coursed down his cheeks and guttered around his nose.  With the tips of his finger he tasted the warm salt water. \par }\pard \ltrpar\qj \li0\ri0\sl-320\slmult0\nowidctlpar\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0\pararsid16453515 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid14838232\charrsid615944 \tab The snow had at last begun to melt. A golden light pushed through the tree tops and cast long blue shadows across the snowy ground. The azure firmament was perfectly clear save for a few wisps of cloud, which like some ghostly armada, scudded silently across the sky. A strong wind whipped up the tiny frozen crystals of ice that had settled on the treetops and in the cracks and ledges of the quarry face. Whirling and scattering them before the sun like dust falling across the beam of a projector. The light reflecting from them causing bursts of bright fairy dust to dance upon the air and drift all about. Every so often clumps of white would slide from a branch. The birds, hopping from tree to tree, chattered and whistled as they watched the world around them melt. The rivers and ponds where swollen with the gathering meltwater. The drab brown farmlands dressed with the white straws of dead grass and scattered with brown leaf confetti. Humped piles black snow withered by the side of the road into hard black lumps of dirty ice. The silence of the snow was replaced by the steady drip, drip of the melt water. Innumerable crystal orbs capturing the scene as if each itself were a camera. Hung, suspended by their surface tension alone until, unable to cling no more, they let go. And crashing to the floor, once more, return into the rich brown earth. The snows had all but disappeared. There is a season for everything. It was finally spring again, the killing season.\par }\pard \ltrpar\qj \li0\ri0\sl-320\slmult0\nowidctlpar\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\tx19242\wrapdefault\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0\pararsid16453515 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid16453515 \par End.\par \par \par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid16453515\charrsid16453515 If you enjoyed reading my book why not send me a quick message via the }{\field{\*\fldinst {\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid16144688  HYPERLINK "http://www.obooko.com/obooko_thriller/bookpages3/thr0213-free-ebook-season-for-everything-fairman" }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid16144688 {\*\datafield 00d0c9ea79f9bace118c8200aa004ba90b0200000003000000e0c9ea79f9bace118c8200aa004ba90bc400000068007400740070003a002f002f007700770077002e006f0062006f006f006b006f002e0063006f006d002f006f0062006f006f006b006f005f0074006800720069006c006c00650072002f0062006f006f006b007000610067006500730033002f0074006800720030003200310033002d0066007200650065002d00650062006f006f006b002d0073006500610073006f006e002d0066006f0072002d00650076006500720079007400680069006e0067002d0066006100690072006d0061006e00000000}}}{\fldrslt {\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \cs15\fs24\ul\cf2\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid16453515\charrsid16144688 Feedback link}}}\sectd \ltrsect\linex0\titlepg\sectdefaultcl\sectrsid9532421\sftnbj {\rtlch\fcs1 \af5\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033\insrsid16453515\charrsid16453515  on my obooko.com download page?
